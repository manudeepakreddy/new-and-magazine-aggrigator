Akram, who has 414 Test and 502 ODI wickets for Pakistan, led his country in the 1996 and 1999 World Cups.

And as it is, I spend time with most of the players in the PSL, they all have my number,” Akram was quoted as saying by Cricket Pakistan in an interview.

Citing rudeness and misbehavior among fans and followers of Pakistan, Akram explained his stand and said, “I am not a fool. I keep on hearing and seeing the way people misbehave with their coaches and seniors. The coach isn’t the one playing.”

“The players do that. The coach can only help with planning so if the team loses, I don’t think the coach is not as accountable as we hold him as a nation,” Akram added.

The agenda of the meeting is “discussing on the upcoming cricket season in the view of pandemic prevailing in India”.

The wider scope of the agenda permits the members to also discuss the ICC T20 World Cup and the much-delayed compensation package for domestic cricketers for the cancelled last Ranji Trophy season.

BCCI also wants to host the T20 World Cup in India and during the June 1 ICC Board meet, it would ask the global body to wait on the COVID-19 situation here before any call is taken.

BCCI president Sourav Ganguly is expected to chair Saturday’s meeting from Mumbai. The IPL is expected to restart between September 18 and 20 and end on October 10 with three venues in the UAE, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah hosting the matches.

“Obviously, the main issue would be the IPL schedule. We are expecting 10 double-headers and seven single headers apart from four play-off games (2 qualifiers, one eliminator) including the final. The resumption game and final will be held on weekends,” a senior BCCI official told PTI on the eve of the meeting.

It is expected that a lot of deliberations will also happen on how to procure the services of the overseas players and other logistical aspects including bubble-to bubble transfer.

“England Cricket Board director of cricket Ashley Giles has already said that England players won’t be allowed to play IPL as they would follow the international commitments ahead of ICC T20 World Cup.

“Hopefully, the president and secretary would tell us how the situation of English players will be handled,” a franchise official, who would be tracking the developments, told PTI.

The likes of Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes (if fit), Jofra Archer (if fit), Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran, Eoin Morgan, Moeen Ali are all first team players for their franchises and getting their replacements won’t be easy.

The Indian team’s commitments in England end on September 14 with the last day of the final Test in Manchester and it would directly fly to Dubai aboard a charter flight after the series ends.

Only Hanuma Vihari and Abhimanyu Easwaran are expected to go home as they don’t have IPL contracts for the time being.

World T20 status

The BCCI, for the time being, will not give up on hosting the T20 World Cup in India but with a third wave of COVID-19 predicted during that time of the year, the chances of the global event being shifted to the UAE are high.

There is a possibility that pitches would tire out but then a full IPL in UAE would have meant 60 games.

So even if World T20 is held, during the final phase of IPL, the ICC could ask the Emirates Cricket Board and the BCCI to at least hand over two of the three grounds for the global event.

One ground would be used for the business end of the tournament.

“If we are not able to hold an eight team IPL in India during September and October, how come we will have foolproof arrangement for a 16-team T20 World Cup in India with nine cities?” a Board official asked.

“The bubble breach in IPL happened only when air travel started. I guess it will take another month or two before we can conclude what’s happening,” he said.

New Zealand and SA white ball series cancelled

India were supposed to play six white-ball games against South Africa and New Zealand as a pre cursor to the T20 World Cup but with IPL set to be slotted in the September-October window, the series is not expected to be held at that time of the year.

Also, New Zealand are set to play two Tests in India after the T20 World Cup in November and it remains to be seen how the dates of the event are adjusted in order to accommodate the Test series.

Ranji Trophy compensation

Close to 700 senior domestic cricketers (men) have suffered after the cancellation of the Ranji Trophy last season due to the pandemic.

While BCCI had agreed to a compensation package in January last year but the formula to distribute the package is yet to be worked out.

“Only 73 uncapped domestic cricketers currently have IPL contracts. Playing Vijay Hazare and Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy (Rs 35k per match) can’t make up for the financial losses that these players suffered,” a state unit official said.

“I guess the most feasible solution would be to hand over a lump sum compensation package to the state units and they would accordingly distribute among their players as per their roster from previous season,’ the senior official said."

GUARDIOLA VS. TUCHEL

It’s a meeting of two of the sharpest minds in soccer, seven years after Guardiola and Tuchel were first properly acquainted — in a Munich restaurant where they talked tactics for hours using salt and pepper shakers as props and were so animated that waiters were too afraid to interrupt.


Guardiola is the “benchmark,” according to Tuchel, and is looking to win the 27th major trophy (excluding Spanish Super Cups and English Community Shields) of his 13-year coaching career. It’s his third Champions League final — a first in 10 years — and he won his first two at Barcelona.

Tuchel became the first coach to reach back-to-back finals with different clubs, having lost last year’s title match with Paris Saint-Germain.

The pair are so tactically astute that they are prone to overthinking in big matches. Indeed, whoever has more clarity in his thinking is likely to emerge victorious.

TOO RESTED?

The teams have had contrasting buildups to the final.

While City was able to rotate its lineup in the last weeks of the Premier League with the title wrapped up early, Chelsea was at full tilt through the end of the season to secure a top-four finish.


Are Chelsea’s players tired? Are City’s players lacking sharpness? Guardiola often talks about his players needing to have “rhythm” to be at their best, so it is fair to imagine City’s training sessions being intense even if their recent matches haven’t been so.


In terms of freshness, City should have the edge but Chelsea will be battle-hardened.

NO STRIKERS

Get ready for a strikerless final — kind of.

City is sure to go into the match without a genuine striker, with center forwards Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus on the bench and attacking midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva alternating as “false nines.”

It’s not the first time Guardiola has adopted this tactic — he did so often at Barcelona — but he has never had a team that spreads the goals around as much City’s class of 2020-21 does.

Chelsea is also likely to start without the presence of an out-and-out striker. Timo Werner should start but potentially in a deeper, inside-left role. Mason Mount and either Christian Pulisic or Kai Havertz — all three being attacking midfielders — will complete Chelsea’s forward line.


Expect, then, a midfield minefield. Time on the ball and space will be at a premium, and both teams’ press will be intense. Key will be how clinical Chelsea is on the counterattack.

DEFENSES RULE

It’s unlikely to be a goal-fest at Estádio do Dragão.

City and Chelsea had the best two defensive records both in the Premier League — conceding 32 and 36 goals, respectively — and in the group stage of the Champions League — conceding one goal and two goals, respectively. In the knockout stage, the teams conceded only five goals (two by Chelsea, three by City) between them in 12 games.

Chelsea’s revival under Tuchel since his arrival in January has centered around being tight at the back and smothering the midfield through the energy of N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic and the positioning of Jorginho.

“We want to be annoying, a horrible team to play against,” Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen said.

City, meanwhile, has been transformed by the September signing of center back Ruben Dias, a 23-year-old Portugal international who has played like a veteran.

YOUNG STARS

It speaks volumes about the levels Phil Foden and Mason Mount have reached this season that they are automatic picks for the final, ahead of playing key roles for England at the upcoming European Championship.

The locally born Foden, who turned 21 on Friday, has established himself as a regular starter in City’s front three this season, displacing Raheem Sterling and really shining in the big games with his explosive dribbling and eye for goal.


The 22-year-old Mount has managed to keep his place in Chelsea’s team despite the club’s offseason spending spree of nearly $300 million, mostly on attacking players. Mount takes the set pieces and is the creative linchpin linking Chelsea’s midfield and attack.

Together, they’re at the vanguard of a surge of young, talented attacking midfielders in English soccer.

PREPARE FOR PENALTIES

Major finals are often cagey affairs that become tighter the longer they go, especially when they involve teams from the same country who play each other regularly and therefore know each other so well.

For that reason, the prospect of a penalty shootout is not unrealistic and Chelsea knows all about them. The team has been to two Champions League finals and both ended in shootouts, losing to Manchester United in 2008 and beating Bayern Munich in 2012.

City won’t want the final to go the full distance, given their players’ record from the penalty spot. Just this season, they have missed four of their 11 penalties — one of them against Chelsea when Sergio Aguero chipped a “Panenka” straight into the hands of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.

City’s spot-kick woes have frustrated Guardiola through the years, to such an extent that he even identified goalkeeper Ederson as a potential candidate to take penalties."
"60b115d6715a7c2e24a05b68","Liverpool have reached an agreement to sign centre-back Ibrahima Konate from German side RB Leipzig, the Premier League club said on Friday.

Frenchman Konate, 22, will join the Anfield club on July 1 once his work permit application is approved and medicals are completed.

Financial details of the transfer were not revealed but British media reported Liverpool triggered a 41 million euros ($49.82 million) release clause in his contract. Konate had a contract until June 2023 with Leipzig.


“I’m really happy to be joining such a massive club like Liverpool,” Konate said in a statement.

“It’s a really exciting moment for me and my family and I am really looking forward to meeting my new teammates, the staff and getting started on this new chapter.

“I have worked very hard for many years to get to this point, but I would like to say a big thank you to everyone at RB Leipzig and all the people I worked with there – the coaches, my teammates, the staff and especially the fans.”

Konate will be involved with the France team in the knockout stages of the Under-21 European Championship which begin on May 31.

Liverpool struggled to defend their Premier League title last season after an injury crisis in defence when they lost Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez to season-ending injuries early in the campaign.

"60b11615715a7c2e24a05b69","Nike has confirmed it ended its sponsorship agreement with Neymar after the Brazilian soccer player refused to collaborate in an investigation into an accusation that he sexually assaulted a female employee from the company years ago.

Nike didn’t give a reason last August when it parted ways with the Paris Saint-Germain forward. But the company said in a statement Thursday that it decided to terminate the contract because Neymar refused to participate “in a good faith investigation of credible allegations of wrongdoing by an employee.”

Nike said it could not speak in detail about the case when their deal ended because the investigation was not conclusive.

“No single set of facts emerged that would enable us to speak substantively on the matter,” Nike said. “It would be inappropriate for Nike to make an accusatory statement without being able to provide supporting facts.”

The Wall Street Journal first reported the story on Thursday. The newspaper reported that the Nike employee had told friends as well as colleagues in 2016 that Neymar tried to force her to perform oral sex in his hotel room while in New York, where she was helping to coordinate events and logistics for the player and his entourage.

Nike said it was “deeply disturbed by sexual assault allegations” and confirmed the alleged incident took place in 2016, when Neymar played with Barcelona. Nike said it received an official notice of the incident two years later.

The company said it respected the employee’s initial desire to avoid an investigation and to keep the matter private.

“In 2019, when the employee later expressed interest in pursuing the matter, we acted immediately,” it said. “Nike commissioned an independent investigation and retained separate independent legal counsel for the employee, of her choosing and at the company’s expense.”

Neymar’s representatives declined to respond to a request for comments from The Associated Press. An unidentified spokeswoman for the player told the Wall Street Journal he denied the allegation.

“Neymar Jr. will vigorously defend himself against these baseless attacks in case any claim is presented, which did not happen so far,” she said."
"60b1164a715a7c2e24a05b6a","Andrea Pirlo is leaving Juventus after only one season as coach following a fourth-place finish that ended the club’s run of nine straight Serie A titles.

Juventus did not say in Friday’s statement whose decision it was to go, but reports in Italy say the 42-year-old Pirlo was fired.

Pirlo, a former Juventus player who had never coached at any level, was surprisingly appointed last year after Maurizio Sarri was fired.


“A few months ago, Andrea Pirlo, an icon of world soccer, began his new adventure, his first as a coach,” Juventus said in a statement.

“To do this, first of all, it takes courage, as well as awareness of one’s own means … Pirlo has just begun the first steps of what will no doubt become a brilliant career as a coach.”

Juventus won the Italian Cup and the Super Cup under Pirlo, but Inter Milan won the Serie A title.

The club also faltered in the Champions League, losing to Porto in the round of 16.


“Since in soccer, what counts are the victories, let’s remember them: in the space of a few short months Pirlo’s Juve has raised two trophies: The Italian Supercup and the Coppa Italia. And he, as coach, brought home brilliant victories on the most prestigious of fields, from San Siro to Camp Nou,” Juventus added.

Pirlo’s replacement could be announced imminently. Former Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has reportedly signed a three-year deal at the club — only two seasons after his departure.

Juventus won five straight league and cup doubles under Allegri and also reached two Champions League finals."
"60b1167f715a7c2e24a05b6b","Japan is looking to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas by about three weeks to June 20, a cabinet minister said on Friday, as the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of easing less than two months before the Summer Olympics open.

The state of emergency in the capital and eight other prefectures had been scheduled to end on May 31, but strains on the medical system remain severe. Japan’s southern island of Okinawa is already under a state of emergency set to end on June 20.

Japan has seen a record number of COVID-19 patients in critical condition in recent days, even as the number of new infections has slowed.

“In Osaka and Tokyo, the flow of people is starting to creep up, and there are concerns that infections will rise,” Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who also heads the country’s coronavirus countermeasures, said at the start of a meeting with experts.

The experts later approved the government proposal and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to officially announce the extended state of emergency later on Friday.

Worries about variants of the novel coronavirus and a slow vaccination drive have prompted urgent calls from doctors, some high-profile business leaders and hundreds of thousands of citizens to cancel the Olympic Games, due to start on July 23.

Japanese officials, Olympics organisers and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have said the Games would go ahead under strict virus-prevention measures. IOC Vice President John Coates, who oversees the preparations, said last week the Games were on whether or not the host city, Tokyo, is under an emergency state at the time.

Japan has recorded about 727,000 coronavirus infections and 12,597 deaths so far. About 6 per cent of its population has been vaccinated, according to Reuters data.

ANGER MOUNTS
Comments by IOC officials appearing to dismiss Japanese concerns have sparked outrage on social media, including IOC President Thomas Bach telling an International Athletes Forum on Thursday: “Come with full confidence to Tokyo and get ready”.

“I want to say ‘shut up’,” said one Twitter user. “Let’s beat up on the IOC, which denigrates Japan, and halt these crazy Olympics.”

Polls show a majority of Japanese want the Games, postponed last year due to COVID-19, either cancelled or put off again.

That is a worry for Suga, whose support has slid over his handling of the response to COVID-19 and who faces a general election and a ruling party leadership race later this year.

But cancellation would carry its own political risk for the premier, some ruling party lawmakers said.

“The demerits would outweigh the merits,” Liberal Democratic Party MP Hajime Funada told Reuters. “It would give the impression that Japan is in such dire straits in cannot hold the Games.”

In a joint statement after a summit on Thursday, the European Union and Japan backed Tokyo’s hosting of the Olympic Games this year.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union had authorised the export to Japan of more than 100 million vaccine doses, enough to inoculate about 40 per cent of the population. “We have of course said we are looking forward to the Olympics Games,” she told a news conference."
"60b116b5715a7c2e24a05b6c","Kidambi Srikanth and Saina Nehwal’s slim hopes of qualifying for Tokyo Games ended after the game’s governing body (BWF) on Friday made it clear there will not be any change in the current ranking list and no further tournament will be held inside the qualification period.

Former world no 1 Srikanth and London Games bronze-medallist Saina’s hopes were all but dashed when the last of the Olympic qualifiers in Singapore was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The duo had hung on a slim hope when the governing body said it “will issue a further statement on Tokyo Olympics qualifying at a later date”.

“The Badminton World Federation (BWF) can confirm no further tournaments will be played inside the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualifying window,” the apex body said in a statement on Friday.

“As such, while the qualification period officially closes 15 June 2021 as per the Revised Tokyo 2020 Qualification System, the current Race To Tokyo rankings list will not change.”

Owing to the health crisis, the world body had earlier revised the qualification period, extending it by nearly two months to June 15 after postponement of three important events.

However, with no respite from the pandemic, BWF was forced to cancel or postpone the last three qualifiers — India Open, Malaysia Open and Singapore Open, leaving players, including Srikanth and Saina, with no chance to earn a qualification.

“The Olympic qualification process is in effect closed as there are no additional opportunities for players to earn points,” BWF secretary general Thomas Lund said.

“However, we still need to receive confirmations from National Olympic Committees and Member Associations, followed by any possible reallocations, and this will take a number of weeks to complete.”

According to the qualification rules, the top 16 players – a maximum of two players each in men’s and women’s singles from a country – as on June 15 will gain direct entries.

The BWF said “invitations will be sent shortly with final participation lists and seedings to be published at the conclusion of this process.”

Indian shuttlers who have already made the cut for the Olympics include PV Sindhu, B Sai Praneeth, and the men’s doubles pairing of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy."
"60b116f4715a7c2e24a05b6d","With a little under a week to go before India’s first match in the World Cup 2022 qualifiers against Asian champions Qatar, Indian national football team head coach Igor Stimac highlighted the importance of making up for lost time and exuded confidence of making it to the AFC Asian Cup.

“Our initial plan was to start the camp from mid-April. When that was not possible, we tried to start on May 2 in Kolkata. We also had plans to play a few friendlies. But then the pandemic struck, and everything was cancelled – due to nobody’s fault of course,” said Stimac.

“We have been able to arrange a few days of the camp finally in Doha. It’s not ideal, but it is what it is, and we must get on with making up for the lost time.”

With Asian champions Qatar leading Group E, followed by Oman, securing a top spot may be out of reach, but the Blue Tigers’ Asian dream is very much alive, as they aim to secure a third-placed finish.

“I am very confident that at the end of the journey, we will be in the AFC Asian Cup. Never mind the group position right now, because the actual situation is far from the present,” informed Stimac. “Qatar is a fully prepared team, Bangladesh finished their season on May 10, and 23 out of the 28 Afghan players are playing in Europe or USA with their season in full swing.”


“Our team’s situation is different, but I can promise you that we will give it everything. The boys will give each atom of energy in their bodies to answer all doubts on the pitch. We will do everything to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. Only then, will our proper work start,” he continued.

“We are aware that Qatar is the future host, and they have great facilities for their teams. Perhaps we may have expected more in terms of that, but we appreciate the efforts by Qatar to organise (these matches),” he stated.

Currently standing fourth in Group E of the Qualifiers, behind Asian champions Qatar, Oman and Afghanistan with three points to their name, India are set to play their last three Qualifying matches in Doha, Qatar (due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) against the hosts Qatar (June 3), Bangladesh (June 7), and Afghanistan (June 15).

While the pandemic has been taking a toll on everyone around the world, Stimac believes that his players are motivated enough as they know the situation that everyone is currently facing.

“Motivating them is not a problem. They are all good professionals and I do not have any problem in keeping them motivated,” said Stimac. They are well aware of the situation and are working hard with full commitment on the training pitch with a few days left for the Qualifiers,” he averred. “They know that they are representing their country, and they will do everything possible to defend the India colours.”


As the times and situations all around have gotten difficult due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the Blue Tigers view their glass as half full.

“People are suffering everywhere due to the pandemic, and the boys see this as an opportunity to make everyone in India happy with their performances. We need to take this chance with both hands and bring smiles to all the faces,” Stimac observed.

Stimac went on to explain that his goal has not changed since he took over as the head coach of the Blue Tigers, back in 2019.

“Never mind the situation – our goals have not changed. We will use the initial two years to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. If there was a chance, we would have taken a shot at World Cup qualification too. We have had some setbacks in the form of injuries to key players too – Sandesh (Jhingan), (Rowllin) Borges and Brandon (Fernandes). We have suffered a lot, but we are still alive with our goals. I am convinced that we will qualify for the AFC Asian Cup, and then we can convince India about the quality of our game,” he continued.

Unlike the last match against Qatar 18 months back, or the two friendlies against Oman and UAE earlier this year, Stimac has the services of iconic striker Sunil Chhetri at his disposal. “Having Sunil back is great for each one of us. As I speak, we need to be clever with Sunil every day. We have three games coming up in 12 guys, and we need to decide on how to use him. The Afghanistan and Bangladesh games are more important (in terms of India’s position in the group),” he said. “We will have a clearer picture of the condition of the player in a few days.”

Along with captain Chhetri, his teammate from Bengaluru FC Udanta Singh is also back in the team, and the coach intends to use the attacker’s experience in the big games ahead.

“Udanta paid the price in the ISL because he was not in the best of form. There was also a change in position after the change in coach at his club. But he has shown that he is more than a decent forward – he’s got strength, he’s got speed, and he’s got character. He has proved that he can destroy the best fullbacks in Asia, on his day,” said the Blue Tigers boss.

Igor Stimac had handed debuts to more than 10 players in the two International Friendlies earlier this year, paving the way for a number of new faces in the squad for the Qualifiers in Qatar. However, the coach explained that it was more a case of testing out the good performers in the Hero ISL.


“Most of the youngsters are here to get a feel of the atmosphere of international competitive games. It might happen that they may get a chance, but they are here primarily to learn what is required of them on the pitch and off it,” said Stimac."
"60b11dee1fea113390c81d72","The Pakistan Cricket Board has apparently compromised on its COVID-19 protocols and allowed fast bowler Naseem Shah to re-enter the bio-secure bubble before returning to play in the country’s premier Twenty20 league.

The 18-year-old Shah was expelled last Monday from the remainder of Pakistan Super League after arriving at a team hotel in Lahore with an outdated negative test for COVID-19. The last 20 games of the postponed tournament are being played in the United Arab Emirates.

The PCB’s protocols required all players traveling to Abu Dhabi to present a negative test taken not more than 48 hours prior to arrival at the team hotel. Shah presented a report on Monday from a test that was conducted on May 18.

But after meeting with franchise owners, the PCB allowed Shah to return to the team hotel after returning another negative test COVID-19. Shah will then have to clear two more COVID-19 tests before boarding the last charter flight to Abu Dhabi for the tournament.

Shah is supposed to be the key player for Quetta Gladiators in the PSL. He rose to the fame with his pace when he made his test debut against Australia in November 2019 and then grabbed a hat trick in a test match against Bangladesh at Rawalpindi last year. He has played in nine test matches and grabbed 20 wickets.

The PCB has not yet announced the schedule of the remaining 20 PSL games in Abu Dhabi. The league was postponed in March when several players and support staff among the six franchises tested positive for COVID-19."

“To be honest, first couple of years I didn’t realise pace is something that needs to be added,” he said in a video posted by his IPL team SunRisers Hyderabad on its twitter handle.

“As I kept playing, I realised with swing I need to improve my pace because bowling in late 120kph or just 130kph, batsmen were adjusting to the swing. So, I wanted to increase the pace, but I didn’t know how to do it…

The 31-year-old has so far taken 63 wickets in 21 Tests, 138 and 45 scalps in 117 ODIs and 48 T20Is.

“Fortunately, I was able to improve the pace and that really helped me in the later stages. So yes, when you have pace, not the express 140-plus, but bowling in the mid-130kph helps maintaining that swing and keep the batsman guessing,” he said.

Bhuvneshwar has been troubled by injuries and was not considered for the upcoming World Test Championship final against New Zealand in Southampton and the five-match Test series against England."
"60b11e4b1fea113390c81d74","Indian boxer Sakshi Choudhary (54kg) has lost her final spot in the Asian Championships after her rival, top-seeded Kazakh Dina Zholaman, successfully challenged the narrow victory that the two-time youth world champion had clinched in the last-four stage.

Sakshi had prevailed 3-2 in the regulation bout but the decision was challenged by the Kazakh team and eventually overturned.

“Kazakhstan’s Dina Zholaman defeated India’s Sakshi Choudhary at the women’s bantamweight (54kg),” the Asian Boxing Confederation announced.

Zholaman was the declared winner in the official result sheet that came out at the end of the day’s proceedings late on Thursday night.

“The Kazakh team sought a review of the third round, which it felt should have been scored in favour of their boxer. On review, the jury found their contention to be correct and overturned the original verdict,” a source in the Indian contingent told PTI.

The bout review system was introduced by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) in 2019.

The team manager or the head coach of the losing boxer gets 15 minutes after the decision is announced to submit their protest and complete the paperwork for it in the next 30 minutes.

Decisions with scores 5-0 or 4-1 are not reviewable under this system.

Each team is allowed up to two failed reviews.

“If the Technical Delegate determines, after consulting the Bout Review Jury, that the protest should be allowed to proceed, the bout will be reviewed by the Jury � the Observer, the Referee Evaluator and the Judge Evaluator,” the AIBA had said.

In case of a protest claiming that an AIBA technical rule was violated by the referee, the aggrieved team has to specify the breach, the round in which it allegedly took place, and how it affected the final result.

The jury’s decision must be unanimous and will be final.

With this, Indian women boxers’ presence in the finals has been reduced to four.

Six-time world champion M C Mary Kom (51kg), Lalbuatsaihi (64kg), Pooja Rani (75kg) and Anupama (+81kg) entered the finals after winning their bouts on Thursday.

Of these, Pooja got a walkover after her opponent pulled out."

The New York Knicks said on Thursday a fan who spat on Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks in the fourth quarter of their game had been banned from Madison Square Garden.

“This was completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our venue,” the Knicks said in a statement, while also apologising to Young and the Hawks. “We have turned the information over to the appropriate authorities.”

At a game between Utah and Memphis, three Jazz fans were removed by Vivint Arena staff for heckling the family of the Grizzlies’ Ja Morant.


“The Utah Jazz have zero tolerance for offensive or disruptive behaviour,” the Jazz said in a statement.

“An incident occurred last night involving a verbal altercation during Game 2. Arena security staff intervened, and the investigation resulted in the removal and banning of three Jazz fans indefinitely.”

The Philadelphia 76ers said they had revoked a fan’s season ticket with immediate effect and banned him from all events at the Wells Fargo Center after he poured popcorn on Washington Wizards’ Russell Westbrook.

The Wizards guard was limping to the locker room with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter and was showered with popcorn by a fan seated above the tunnel. A furious Westbrook had to be restrained by staff and security guards.

“We apologise to Russell Westbrook and the Washington Wizards for being subjected to this type of unacceptable and disrespectful behaviour,” the 76ers said. “There is no place for it in our sport or arena.”

Westbrook called for more protection for the players, saying there were numerous instances where fans in the stands felt they were “untouchable”.

“There has to be some penalties or something put in place where fans just can’t come to the games and do and say as they please,” he added.

The NBA urged fans to show respect for players and officials and said it will vigorously enforce an enhanced code of conduct to ensure a “safe and respectful environment for all involved”.

The National Basketball Players Association said that true fans would honour and respect the dignity of players.

“No true fan would seek to harm them or violate their personal space,” the group said in a statement.

“Those who do have no place in our arenas.

"60b11ef41fea113390c81d76","Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer all ended up in the same half of the French Open men’s field in the draw Thursday, meaning no more than one of them can reach the final.

The Big Three top the leaderboard for Grand Slam men’s singles titles: Federer and Nadal head to Roland Garros, where play begins Sunday, tied with 20, while Djokovic has 18.

Nadal beat Djokovic in straight sets in the 2020 final for his record-extending 13th championship on the red clay of Paris, but if they meet again this time, it would be in the semifinals. Nadal is ranked and seeded No. 3 now and so he could have wound up on either side of the bracket; as luck would have it, he was placed in No. 1 Djokovic’s half.

So was Federer, whose record for most weeks atop the ATP rankings recently was broken by Djokovic and is currently at No. 8 after playing only three matches over the past 15 months because of two operations on his right knee. Federer could meet Djokovic in the quarterfinals.

The other possible men’s quarterfinals on their side is Nadal vs. No. 7 Andrey Rublev.


On the other side of the draw, the potential quarterfinals are No. 2 Daniil Medvedev vs. No. 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas, and No. 4 Dominic Thiem vs. No. 6 Alexander Zverev.

Medvedev is a two-time Grand Slam finalist but is 0-4 for his French Open career. Thiem won last year’s US Open and twice has been the runner-up in Paris.

Serena Williams, who has won three of her professional-era record 23 Grand Slam titles in Paris, is in a quarter of the women’s draw filled with familiar faces.

That includes possible matchups with three-time major champion Angelique Kerber in the third round, two-time Wimbledon champ Petra Kvitova in the fourth and either two-time Australian Open champ Victoria Azarenka or No. 3 seed Aryna Sabalenka in the quarterfinals.

The other possible women’s quarterfinals are No. 1 Ash Barty vs. No. 5 Elina Svitolina, No. 4 Sofia Kenin vs. No. 8 Iga Swiatek in what would be a rematch of the 2020 final won by Swiatek, and No. 2 Naomi Osaka vs. No. 6 Bianca Andreesscu.


Four-time major champion Osaka announced Wednesday on Twitter that she would not be doing news conferences during the French Open.

A year after withdrawing from Roland Garros before the second round because of an injured left Achilles, Williams will face 74th-ranked Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania to begin things. They met once before: On red clay in Rome in 2016, the year Begu reached the fourth round in Paris for the deepest French Open run of her career.

Other first-round matches of interest include Swiatek against Kaja Juvan, a 20-year-old from Slovenia who beat Kerber in the first round in Paris last year; Azarenka against another owner of two major trophies, Svetlana Kuznetsova; and Kenin, last year’s Australian Open champion, against 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko.

Nadal and Swiatek are the favorites to win the singles titles, according to FanDuel Sportsbook."
"60b11f691fea113390c81d77","German javelin thrower Johannes Vetter is giving the phrase ‘new normal’ a context outside of the pandemic.

What has become habitual this season for the 6’1″ and 103-kilogram athlete from Dresden are 90 metre-plus throws. Vetter, a favourite for the Olympic gold in Tokyo, has seven such throws this season.

His recent feats are evoking comparisons with one of the greatest, world record holder Jan Zelezny. The Czech’s 14 throws over 90 metres back in 1995 is a single-season record, according to World Athletics. Vetter remains in the shadow of the Czech great, but for how long is the question.

In September, Vetter came close to bettering Zelezny’s hallowed mark of 98.48 metres set in the mid-nineties.

At the Continental Tour Gold event in Chorzow, Poland, officials, caught napping, had to run to the far end of the field to retrieve the javelin. Vetter’s 97.76 metres was as close as anyone had got to rewriting the record books since Zelezny in 1996.

In the year of the postponed Olympics, the 28-year-old has made ‘consistency’ his middle name. In a short span of time, he has won four events in a row with 90-metre throws. Only Zelezny, with five back-to-back wins in the same year, can boast of a better run at this distance.


Built like an oak and strong as an ox, Vetter has combined technique and power to become an awe-inspiring giant in the javelin throw. Every other week, he has launched carbon-fused meteors across stadiums as ‘gravity-defying’ becomes less of a cliché.

Wind conditions or the temperature, two factors that can affect participants of the outdoor event, were overcome by Vetter as if they did not matter.

Last Wednesday at the World Athletics Continental Tour at Ostrava, Croatia, Vetter produced 94.20 metres, a world-leading distance. After the event, while talking about the conditions, Vetter told the official broadcaster, “I think it was 12 degrees here, the wind was a bit difficult, always changing a bit, the wind directions, still 94.20 metres.”

Two days later on Friday, Vetter didn’t go off the boil. At the Anhalt Meeting, part of the World Athletics Continental Tour Bronze series, in Dessau, he registered a throw of 93.20 metres in the third round. He followed it up with 88.09 metres after which he decided not to stretch himself and skipped the last two rounds.

“It was a great throw,” said the 2017 World Championships gold medallist. “But of course the world record would be even better. It was great training for me. I made only small mistakes and managed to hit the javelin very cleanly.”

Questions about the world record are bound to be asked to Vetter. With two months to go for the Olympics, experts believe one of the longer-standing marks could fall.

“His technique has improved and is more stable in the important parts. He will probably do it sometime (break the record). Maybe this year. He is also not far from 100 metres. Can’t see someone else doing this at the moment,” Uwe Hohn, the only athlete to throw the javelin over 100 metres, tells The Indian Express.


Hohn, the javelin coach of the Indian team, achieved what is known as the ‘eternal world record’ of 104.80 metres in 1984. Two years later the centre of gravity of the sphere was moved forward to shorten distances.

Vetter’s countryman and 2016 Rio Olympics gold medallist Thomas Röhler has spoken about wanting to throw 100 metres. “I said to people I want to throw the 100, just to find out if it is possible for humans,” Röhler told Trans World Sport in an interview.

With the competition circuit getting busier ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, some of the top throwers including Röhler will begin their season soon. In a sport of fine margins, fortunes can change quickly.

Personal loss, injury

Vetter looks to be close to his very best this year after overcoming personal loss and injury.

When he won the 2017 World Championships gold in London, Vetter was going through a difficult time because his mother was unwell.

“It was a crazy time because my mom had a surgery one week before because of a brain tumour. I was also struggling with my back one week before the World Championships started. When I was winning the title, I was making a round of the stadium and I saw my father in the crowd and it was like really emotional because my mom was that ill and it was like a bit of mental pain but I was really happy that my family stands behind me,” Vetter told World Athletics’s podcast last year.

By the end of 2018, Vetter’s mother passed away. He says the family knew she would die following the medical diagnosis. “It was really hard to handle. Private life is very hard and your sports life is really tough as well.”

It took almost half of 2019 to figure out why the left ankle was troubling Vetter. He would have doctor visits every week and injections became a part of his life. At the Doha World Championships, Vetter finished third. Four days later he went in for surgery. Post-operation, Vetter was able to take time to reflect on what he went through over the past two years.

“I had some time to realise what happened during the last one and a half, two, three years. It helped me a lot to find my way back into life.”

This weekend Vetter will be at the European Athletics Team Championships, another competition he will be using to build up for the Tokyo Olympics. There is anticipation about how far the German will throw.


Chopra’s predicament

The luxury of travel and participating in competitions abroad is something India’s Olympic medal hope Neeraj Chopra does not have. Restrictions imposed by countries on flights from India because of the pandemic and the mandatory lengthy quarantine have resulted in Chopra being stuck at the National Institute of Sports in Patiala.

Two years away from international competition, because of injury as well as the pandemic, has left him frustrated. At the 3rd Indian Grand Prix in early March, Chopra rewrote his national record with a throw of 88.07metres. But since then he has been on a constant cycle of just training.


“It is getting difficult because along with training, I need competition. Most of 2019, I missed because of injury and in 2020 and 2021, nothing has happened because of Covid. How long will one be patient? For one year or two years…,” Chopra had said earlier this month.

Dr. Klaus Bartonietz, a biomechanical expert and coach Hohn are now trying to get Chopra to replicate ‘competition mode’ during practice.

“Neeraj is throwing better in training and throwing also more intensive but it’s not replacing competitions that he needs urgently. You can also see that Vetter’s technique… sometimes he is jumping forward, sometimes he is doing a better block but to practice that you need competitions without pressure of throwing far… to transfer the technique into competition,” Hohn says.

Both Klaus and Hohn are continuously working on Chopra’s technique while keeping an eye on what the likes of Vetter are doing even as he keeps threatening to break the world record. The German coaching pair have a lot of faith in Chopra. “Neeraj has the talent for it also…,” Hohn says."
"60b11faf1fea113390c81d78","Former opener Mark Butcher feels the ECB should have agreed to the BCCI’s request to change the Test series schedule to accommodate the remaining games of IPL as it would have given the England Board the leverage to get top Indian players for its ‘Hundred’ tournament.

The Indian Board had informally made a request to shift the five-match Test series between India and England, starting August 4, by a week in order to accommodate the remaining 31 IPL games but it has not met with any favourable response from England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).

“Well, listen. I take a deep breath here … as does the nation. I think it’s a massive missed opportunity,” Butcher said during the latest Wisden Cricket Weekly Podcast.

Butcher said accepting the request would have given ECB the leverage to get top Indian cricketers such as Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni for ‘The Hundred’ tournament, the ECB’s flagship project.

“…the ECB is absolutely desperate to make this (Hundred) work. They have to be, they have bet the house on The Hundred, but at every turn, it seems a greater power doesn’t want it to happen,” said the 48-year-old Butcher who played 71 Tests for England between 1997 and 2004.

“And so for me, this was the opportunity where you’ll say ‘Okay, we’ll bite the bullet… We would do this for the BCCI on the proviso that we get Kohli, Dhoni, whoever we like, signed up for three years to play in The Hundred, starting 2022’.”

The inaugural edition of ‘The Hundred’, a 100-ball tournament involving eight men’s and women’s teams, was scheduled to take place last year but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“And you have leverage for the first time ever: you have something that they need, that they want. Obviously, the BCCI will lose a lot of money if they don’t get the IPL in the window,” Butcher said.

“You also have the extraordinary spectacle of the IPL being finished at the behest or because of English cricket. And you use that lever in order to get something you desperately need. So I think there’s an opportunity missed.”

The IPL was suspended early this month after multiple COVID-19 cases were reported inside its bio-bubble.

According to a senior BCCI official, the IPL will now resume tentatively on September 18 or 19 in the UAE with as many as 10 double-headers expected to be played during a three-week window."
"60b120121fea113390c81d79","Australia head coach Justin Langer must change his coaching style if wants to continue in his role, an end-of-season review of cricket Down Under has warned.

A source-based report in the ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ said, the 50-year-old was given a “strong and straightforward” feedback — taken from 40 players and support staff — about his coaching style as part of the team’s regular end-of-season reviews.

Earlier this year, after an under-strength India came back from behind to hammer Australia 2-1 in their own den, some players had expressed dissatisfaction over Langer’s management style because of his intensity and mood swings.

Langer was appointed as the head coach on a four-year contract in 2018 after Darren Lehmann had stepped down in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal.

The players also expressed discontentment towards team manager Gavin Dovey.

Langer’s response to the feedback across the rest of the year will decide whether he will be handed a new contract.

“This is effectively identical to the process undertaken before the last World Cup and the 2019 Ashes where the team performed strongly,” CA’s national teams boss Ben Oliver said in a statement to the publication.

“It’s part of our ongoing commitment to on-and off-field improvement and we expect it will have a similar benefit in the team’s preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup and home Ashes,” he added.

The report stated that leadership consultant Tim Ford, who oversaw the reintegration of Steve Smith and David Warner to the team two years ago after the ball-tampering bans, also conducted a second review process.

“Ford interviewed players virtually towards the end of the home season, with their responses to be kept anonymous.”

“…in a wide-ranging review, which checked on player welfare at the end of a difficult season, he asked for their thoughts on the team’s values and what needed updating since they last underwent the process with him two years ago.”

He will handover the findings of the report to team leaders Tim Paine, Pat Cummins and Aaron Finch next week.

“Langer will also receive the feedback from Ford’s report though the comments were not as hard as the player review from the end of the season,” the media report stated.

Assistant coach Andrew McDonald received good reviews with players, saying he was more approachable.

“In contrast to reports from the dressing room during the Australian summer, players spoke glowingly in public of the mood and team environment under McDonald, whom members of the Test side had gravitated towards due to his more approachable manner.”"
"60b120ad1fea113390c81d7a","The immense popularity of Friends can be gauged by the fact that a reunion special episode that aired on Thursday is the biggest thing in pop culture at the moment. Evidence suggests that it is likely driving fans to subscribe to HBO Max, the streaming service of WarnerMedia.

That the show, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, is still as popular as it was in the 1990s is the testament to its actors’ star power. The series’ actors, particularly the big six, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, were a huge factor in making Friends iconic.


Here’s what the stars have done in their career since the show ended.

Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green)

Jennifer Aniston, it can be argued, became the most well-known actor among the main Friends cast members. She starred opposite Jim Carrey in the comedy film Bruce Almighty in 2003. She was also a lead actor in other, successful comedy films like The Break-Up, Marley & Me, The Bounty Hunter, Just Go with It, Horrible Bosses, and We’re the Millers, and so on. In 2019, she made a comeback to television with Apple TV+ with The Morning Show, which also had in the cast Reese Witherspoon, a guest star in Friends, and Steve Carell. She is also an executive producer on the show.

Courteney Cox (Monica Geller)

During her post-Friends career, Cox’s best known works include drama series Dirt and sitcom Cougar Town. Cox has also tried her hand at direction with 2014’s Just Before I Go, albeit with less than ideal results.

Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay)

On International Women’s Day and in particular, Mother’s Day, film journalists (mea culpa) cheerfully list it as a must-watch. Whether or not young audiences are drawn to it despite all the good press is hard to guess. But thanks to Nargis’ mother of all performances in the mother of all Hindi movies, the 1957 classic has a secured place in Bollywood’s rarefied sanctum. In addition to giving us Nargis’ ballsy act, Naushad’s magnum opus music, Sunil Dutt’s devilish rogue performance, the evil Lala and the milky river of melodrama that has only served to sweeten future Hindi films, Mother India has one main contribution that has outlasted everything else — the ‘mother’ trope, obviously."
"60b121b81fea113390c81d7c","Debutante Sonia Rathee is ‘beyond excited’ about her upcoming show, Broken But Beautiful 3. A story and love and heartbreak, with obsession and complicated emotions thrown in for good measure, the AltBalaji show returns with a new cast this time — fan favourite Sidharth Shukla, who is making his first big appearance after stepping out of Bigg Boss house, with Sonia in tow.

Sonia is all set for the journey. “I am just in awe at how many people liked our trailer. I am just hoping they like the show too,” she said hours before the premiere of  Broken But Beautiful 3. The Indo-American actor, in an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com, said she was aware of her co-star’s popularity but refrained from reading too much on him.

“He is all over social media and we all know how much he is loved. But I really did not want to go in with a preconceived notion. I wanted to judge him for myself,” said Sonia, adding that it was a blast working with Sidharth.

“It was great and so much fun with him. There was actually never a boring moment when Sidharth was around. He used to pull jokes at everyone, and I was such an easy target. He is an absolute favourite of everyone and I really enjoyed shooting with him,” shared Sonia Rathee.


The Bigg Boss 13 winner is also making his digital debut with the show. From the time the first look of his character, Agastya Rao, has been revealed fans have been in a frenzy. However, there has been a section that wanted Sidharth and Shehnaaz Gill in the lead role. However, for Sonia, the actor shared that she is overwhelmed with the way his fans welcomed her, “I have gotten such great feedback. I am just overwhelmed to have got an audience like that. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting so many people to show so much love. I am just too grateful for it.”

Interestingly, the actor revealed that she feels she manifested Broken But Beautiful 3 in her life. Her brother Ankur Rathee’s fiance Anuja Joshi was part of the second season (Debbie), and Sonia had accompanied her to a photoshoot for the show. “I had just moved to India and tagged along with her. I was so impressed that I was wishing I could also get a project like this. I think I completely manifested it,” she shared with a smile.


 

However, it was the character of Rumi that made the young actor say yes. Having gone through three rounds of audition, as she started finding more about the part, she wanted to do it. “Rumi is this 20-something girl still figuring out life. She is like most of us and what I really loved about her was her feistiness. No one can dare tell her something. She is also very emotional, but the show has beautifully graphed her journey as she grows up.”

The first two seasons of the web series starred Harleen Sethi and Vikrant Massey, and were loved by all. However, she says she didn’t feel any pressure.


“While filming I knew it was a very different project from what has been done, hence I didn’t feel like that. I had blocked out the past seasons and I am thankful that no one made a comparison. However, now that people are asking then, yes, maybe there is a pressure,” she said.

Lastly, stating that everything that ‘breaks’ leaves something ‘beautiful’ behind, Sonia said, “We all go through heart breaks, we all get our trust broken. However, every experience teaches us something and gives us a chance to grow.”

Starting May 29, Broken But Beautiful 3 will stream on ALTBalaji and later on MXPlayer."
"60b1224d1fea113390c81d7d","Telugu movie Rang De, starring Nithiin and Keerthy Suresh in the lead roles, is all set to release on ZEE5. Announcing the release date of the film on Friday, ZEE5 tweeted, “The film that you have been waiting for a long time, the magical love tale Range De streams from 12th June only on #ZEE5.”

The digital release of Rang De comes after over two months of its theatrical release. Helmed by Venky Atluri of Tholiprema fame, the film released in cinema halls on March 26 to mixed reviews.


Indianexpress.com’s Manoj Kumar R wrote in his review, “One of the primary duties of cinema is to provide comfort, especially in times we feel the world is folding on itself. Rang De is one such film filled with happy and feel-good moments. The familiarity of the characters and story actually works in the favour of the film. It sort of feels like a comforting blanket, which gives you much-needed warmth and allows you to delight in a sense of nostalgia.”


Produced by Suryadevara Naga Vamsi under the Sithara Entertainments banner, the movie has music by Devi Sri Prasad. The songs topped the charts for a long time, and it helped pull cine-goers to theatres.

Rang De will begin streaming on ZEE5 from June 12."

Neetu, who is quite active on her Instagram account, shared a photo on her Instagram story where she is seen with Soni Razdan, Anu Ranjan and another friend on Thursday night.

While Neetu shared the selfie from this get-together with dancing ladies gif, Anu Ranjan shared another photo from the ladies night and wrote, “Making memories last forever 💜.”

See the latest photos from Neetu Kapoor and Soni Razdan’s party night:

This is not the first time Neetu and Soni were seen sharing a frame. Neetu earlier shared a photo with Soni, Alia, and Shaheen Bhatt. Her caption read, “Some happy moments shared with some very happy special people ❤️🥰🍾.” Soni Razdan had also shared a photo from that get-together.

Soni had also shared a photo from the jungles of Ranthambore in Rajasthan where she was vacationing along with Shaheen, Alia, Ranbir, Neetu and Riddhima Kapoor Sahni on New Year’s Eve. Coincidentally, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone were also holidaying at the same place.


Alia and Ranbir started dating in 2017. Both Alia and Ranbir have publicly acknowledged their relationship, as have their family members.

"60b123741fea113390c81d7f","There’s something eerie as soon as you enter the Sunflower housing society, at least that’s what its trailer suggests. The latest Zee5 web series is expected to give the audience a murder mystery with a twist. Starring actors Sunil Grover, Ashish Vidyarthi, Ranvir Shorey, Girish Kulkarni and Mukul Chadda, Sunflower looks exciting for reasons more than one.

Sunflower revolves around an ‘uncooperative’ society by the same name, and its quirky residents. But the common thread running between all of them is their mysterious traits. The story follows its residents’ quest towards making Sunflower the best housing society, until it gets embroiled in a murder investigation. Enter Shorey and Kulkarni who play cops, trying to uncover the layers of the whodunit.


Sunflower has dollops of dark humour and an interesting background music. Grover seems to be projecting an alter ego with a suspicious innocence. His jokes aren’t on the fun side. There’s something unappealing about Chadda’s character too. In short, Sunflower is laced with elements that show that there is more to it than meets the eye.


The eight-episode series, also starring Shonali Nagrani, Saloni Khanna and Radha Bhatt, has been written and co-directed by Vikas Bahl, along with Rahul Sengupta at the helm.

Produced by Reliance Entertainment and Good Co., Sunflower is slated to premiere on Zee5 on June 11."
"60b123da1fea113390c81d80","Actor Sonu Sood has been actively helping people across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic, but he also knows how to take things with a pinch of salt.

On Friday, Sonu took to Instagram to share a video of his milkman Guddu. The conversation between the two is what makes the clip interesting. According to Guddu, Sonu has given him a separate phone to receive calls from those who wish to reach out to the actor’s foundation for help. Revealing that he has to attend non-stop calls even at odd hours, Guddu’s frustration is evident.


We can also hear the Bollywood actor telling the milkman that even he is ready for help throughout the day. Guddu says, “Sir aapka alag dimag hai. Hamare paas itni capacity nahi hai na. Hum itna jhel nahi paate (Sir, you are smart. I don’t have the capacity to handle so much pressure, like you.)” Sonu tells him not to feel bad as he was doing noble work, while advising him to leave the job of selling milk and take up social service full time.

Sonu Sood, who has started an NGO titled Sood Charity Foundation, has been at the forefront of helping Covid-19 patients amid the pandemic. He also helped thousands of migrant workers reach their home during the lockdown last year."
"60b124931fea113390c81d81","It seems director Radha Mohan delivers his best when he works with Prakash Raj or Jyothika. When he is not working with either of them, he serves up mediocre fare. Case in point is his latest movie, Malaysia to Amnesia, which was released on Zee5 on Friday.

Malaysia to Amnesia opens with Arun, played by Vaibhav Reddy, wandering around a beach in Chennai. He looks exhausted, confused and homeless. He has got a ‘who am I?’ vibe about him and he is sort of bothering the early morning joggers and walkers at the beach. Then, he’s recognized by his childhood friend, Prabhu (Karunakaran). Arun’s family is taken aback when they find him in Chennai in a disoriented state, when he was supposed to be in Malaysia attending a business meeting. To further complicate things, he seems to have lost his memory. Ergo the film’s title, Malaysia to Amnesia

Radha Mohan, who has also written the film, limits the Crazy Mohan-esque humour only to the film’s title, as the film fails to deliver in the writing department, with the use of tropes making the film feel outdated. For a film, which depends majorly on lie, deceit and adultery for humour, Malaysia to Amnesia is depressingly unwitty.

The protagonist has very little contribution to drive the narrative forward. It is, in fact, his wife Sujatha (Vani Bhojan), uncle Mannaru (M.S. Bhaskar), and Prabhu (Karunakaran) who do all the talking. Vaibhav Reddy is as clueless as Radha Mohan when it comes to his character. Vani Bhojan gives a cute performance as a dutiful housewife, who never doubts her husband. And Bhaskar, as a curious man with a list of unending questions, singlehandedly carries the film with his energetic performance and makes it tolerable."

Reeves and filmmaker Chad Stahelski are returning for the new movie in the franchise after collaborating on three earlier parts — John Wick (2014), John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum (2019).

According to Deadline, the details of Sawayama’s character have been kept under wraps.

The pop star was born in Japan and raised in North London. She came to pop stardom from Cambridge University where she studied politics, psychology and sociology.

Sawayama funded her early music through proceeds from modeling, before signing a record deal.

After grabbing attention with singles like “XS”, “Comme des Garcons”, and “Chosen Family”, she released her album “Sawayama”, which was a big hit.

"60b125f51fea113390c81d83","Friends: The Reunion, the special episode of the popular sitcom Friends, was censored by China, with a few of the guest appearances getting shaved off. The appearances of the K-pop band BTS, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga were edited out from the episode, renedring it shorter by about six minutes.

As per a Hollywood Reporter report, China’s leading video platforms — iQiyi, Tencent Video and Alibaba’s Youku acquired the rights of the special episode but all of them censored the 110-minute episode.

The streamers removed the portion where BTS lead RM shared his love for the show and its cast. The Korean pop band has been a target of censors in China since it talked about the sacrifices of South Korean and U.S. soldiers during the Korean War. The comment of the band outraged people in China as the country supported North Korea in the war.


Lady Gaga’s version of “Smelly Cat” also got chopped as the singer is banned in the country ever since her meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016. Justin Bieber irked the country after his Instagram post about his visit to Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo in 2014. The religious site is a matter of international controversy and the singer has been blacklisted in China ever since.

Besides these cuts, the streaming services also cut the comments of the LGBTQ fans of Friends. However, despite the edits, the episode received a great response from the viewers in the country. Hollywood Reported stated that the special currently has a sky-high 9.5/10 rating on China’s movie and TV reviews site Douban, making it one of the highest-rated TV imports.

"60b128661fea113390c81d87","The Narcotics Control Bureau arrested Siddharth Pithani in a drug case linked to the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Hyderabad on Friday.

Siddharth was Sushant’s creative manager and flatmate and was first questioned by the Mumbai Police just days after his death. Pithani was hired by Sushant in 2018 to work on a project. Mumbai Police said that Pithani was aware that Sushant was prescribed medication for depression but had stopped taking these medicines in the days leading up to his death.

At the time, a senior police official told The Indian Express, “Pithani told us that he was not aware of the reason why Rajput was depressed. As he had been staying at Rajput’s home, he had, however, overheard the actor’s staff saying that he had stopped taking the medicines in the past few weeks as he was feeling better.”


As per a report by PTI, Pithani had sent an email to Mumbai Police wherein he stated that he was “being pressured by Rajput’s family to record a statement against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.”

Sidharth Pithani was also questioned by Enforcement Directorate in connection with its probe into a money laundering case linked to the actor’s death.

When the CBI took over the case, Pithani was questioned by them in August at the DRDO guest house located at Kalina in Santacruz, Mumbai. The CBI took Pithani, cook Neeraj Singh and domestic help Deepesh Sawant, to reconstruct events from June 14 at the late actor’s house.

In the Disney+ show, created by Michael Waldron, the God of Mischief is apprehended by the Time Variance Authority (TVC), a mysterious multiversal, highly bureaucratic organisation that keeps a watch at the different timelines and even removes those that are, in their opinion, too dangerous to exist.


Loki also asserts that he is a “bit of both” when it comes to the question as to whether he is good or bad.

Owen Wilson plays one of TVC’s employees called Mobius M. Mobius, who has Loki under arrest and wants his help to restore order in the multiverse.

Kate Herron has directed all the six episodes.

Loki is one of MCU’s most-awaited TV shows as it has at its centre one of the the franchise’s most popular characters. Loki has long been one of the most acclaimed MCU villains and been more of an anti-hero than an out and out villain of late.


The official synopsis of Loki reads, ““Loki” features the God of Mischief as he steps out of his brother’s shadow in a new series that takes place after the events of “Avengers: Endgame.” Tom Hiddleston returns as the title character, joined by Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Sophia Di Martino, Wunmi Mosaku and Richard E.

In his post, he also requested the government to honour his legacy by honouring him with the Bharat Ratna posthumously. He asserted that NTR should be honoured in the same way that Assamese singer, poet, and musician Bhupen Hazarika was posthumously awarded with India’s highest civilian award.

His Instagram post, which is in Telugu, says, “It would be a proud moment for all the Telugu people if Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao is conferred with posthumous Bharat Ratna, just like how they did for the great singer Bhupen Hazarika. With the centenary birth celebrations (of NTR) ahead, if he could be honoured with the coveted award, it would be a great pride for the Telugu people as well. Remembering the towering persona on his birth anniversary.”


Chiranjeevi had shared the screen with NTR in Tiruguleni Manishi in 1981.

"60b12a111fea113390c81d8a","Actor Randeep Hooda has been removed as the ambassador of the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) — an environmental treaty of the United Nations, said its secretariat, in a statement. The move comes after an old video went viral where the actor was seen making a joke on the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, which several said was “casteist and sexist”. He was speaking at an event hosted by the media house, India Today, in 2012.

The CMS Secretariat said that it had become aware of a video clip recently and found the comments made in the video to be “offensive”. It said that they “did not reflect the values” of the CMS Secretariat or the United Nations. It also added that the organisation was unaware of the 2012 video at the time Hooda was appointed as a CMS Ambassador for Migratory Species in February 2020.


It made it clear that CMS, also known as the Bonn Convention, is a treaty of the United Nations and separate from both the UN Secretariat and the UN Environment Programme. CMS was the only entity Hooda for whom served as a brand ambassador. The actor was nominated as the ambassador along with Australian explorer and environmentalist Sacha Dench and British biologist Ian Redmond OBE and had to serve his duties in 2023.

The video clip resurfaced on Twitter on Tuesday after a user posted it and has created an uproar on social media. Several people, including CPI-ML Politburo member Kavita Krishnan, called out the “casteist and sexist” nature of the joke. Many demanded an apology from Hooda, while #ArrestRandeepHooda trended on the microblogging site. Meanwhile, the actor has not issued any statement in response.

"60b12a821fea113390c81d8b","Todd Phillips, who co-wrote and directed 2019’s DC movie Joker, is returning to write its sequel, as per a report in The Hollywood Reporter. In a report about Hollywood’s most powerful lawyers in THR, a statement says Phillips has struck a deal to co-write the sequel with Warner Bros.


It was first claimed in The Hollywood Reporter in November, 2019, that a sequel to the Joaquin Phoenix-starrer is in the works. It is not clear if Phoenix will be back to play the role. The first film ended on an ambiguous note.

Phoenix told IndieWire in 2019 that the possibilities are “endless” for the sequel. He said, “I don’t know that there is [more to do],” Phoenix said. “Me and Todd would still be shooting now if we could, right? Because it seemed endless, the possibilities of where we can go with the character.”


Joker told the origin story of the Clown Prince of Crime, the most famous comic-book supervillain and the arch nemesis of Batman.

The film was made on a budget of about 55 million dollars, and went on to collect 1.07 billion dollars. Due to the huge difference between its budget and gross collection, it is considered to be the most profitable comic-book movie ever.

Joker also generated a lot of controversy, as some critics claimed the film aimed to humanise American real-life gun-toting mass murderers. But the film received the ultimate acknowledgement – from the Academy in the form of 11 Oscar nominations.

Phoenix went on to clinch the Best Actor Oscar, becoming the second actor after Heath Ledger to win an Oscar for his portrayal of Joker. Hildur Guðnadóttir, the film’s composer also won the Oscar for Best Original Score."

The film titled Swatantra Veer Savarkar will be directed by filmmaker and actor Mahesh Manjrekar. He was last seen in John Abraham’s The Mumbai Saga.

On helming the biopic on Savarkar, who propagated Hindu nationalism, Manjrekar said in a statement, “I have forever been fascinated by the life and times of Veer Savarkar. I believe he is a man who didn’t get his due in history. The fact that he evokes such strong emotion points to a life that must have impacted so many. As a director, I know it’s going to be a challenge but one that I want to take on.”

Sandeep Singh, who is backing the project under his banner Legend Global Studio, said, “Veer Savarkar is revered and criticized in equal measure. He has been made into a polarising figure today but I feel that’s because people don’t know enough. No one can deny that he was an important part of our freedom struggle and our attempt is to present a peek into his life and journey.”

The film will be shot across London, the Andamans and Maharashtra. “Swatantra Veer Savarkar promises to change the narrative of the Indian freedom struggle and history,” Singh added. The final cast is yet to be disclosed.


On the occasion of V D Savarkar’s 138th birth anniversary Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to him on Twitter.


Savarkar was born in 1883 in Maharashtra. He has been at the centre of the public discourse ever since Hindutva and cultural nationalism took the centre stage in Indian politics.

The Sony TV series took a break earlier this year as Kapil Sharma went on a paternity break. In an Instagram post, Krushna recalled the madness that was the show and said that he ‘can’t wait all to get well’ so that they can entertain their fans once again.

The actor shared a video from one of the episodes of the show, where Anil Kapoor was a guest. In the video, Krushna is seen impersonating Jackie Shroff, and his antics left Anil in splits. From dressing up in a vest and wearing a scarf to the use of ‘bhidu’ while talking, Krushna definitely aced Jackie’s performance.

He captioned the post, “We all r crazy missing all the madness on the show can’t wait all to get well and come bk soon to entertain all of u 💓 God heal the world 😇@anilskapoor @tigerjackieshroff @kapilsharma @bharti.laughterqueen @archanapuransingh @kikusharda @chandanprabhakar @apnabhidu.”

The order also exempt international scheduled flights allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis, the DGCA added.

"60b12c431fea113390c81d90","India’s economic outlook has weakened again, albeit slightly, with worst-case scenario forecasts suggesting the toll from the coronavirus pandemic could be much deeper, stoking fears the job crisis may worsen over the coming year, a Reuters poll found.

Renewed restrictions to curb the current coronavirus wave have stalled economic activity, leaving many millions out of work and pushing economists – who have broadly been bullish – to downgrade their views for the second time since early April.

The May 20-27 poll showed the outlook for the current quarter was lowered to 21.6% annually, and to 9.8% on average for this fiscal year, down from 23.0% and 10.4% respectively a month ago. The economy was then forecast to grow 6.7% next fiscal year, compared to 6.5% predicted previously.

While the consensus pointed to healthy growth figures later this year, all 29 economists, in response to an additional question, warned the outlook was either “weak and prone to further downgrades” or “fragile, with a limited downside”.

None expected a “strong recovery, followed by an upgrade”.

“Recovery in India was strong in the months before the second wave. This leads us to believe the recovery can rebound quickly after the number of new infections have come down. But vaccination implementation needs to pick up pace in order to have an effect this year,” said Wouter van Eijkelenburg, an economist at Rabobank.

“Therefore new surges of the virus hang above recovery like the sword of Damocles. Until a large share of the population is vaccinated there remains this downside risk of new waves and subsequent lockdowns hampering the recovery.”

Underscoring concerns that a slow vaccine rollout may make a bigger dent in the economy, the consensus showed in a worst-case scenario the economy would average just 6.8% growth this fiscal year after its deepest ever recession last year.

“Let’s hope (the situation) doesn’t go there. If it does and we do have another wave … after this one, maybe the government will learn some lessons – that it is better to lock down the economy sooner, rather than later,” said Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics.

“The threat of further waves will hang over the economic outlook so long as India’s vaccination progress remains lackluster.”

India’s unemployment rate soared to a near one-year-high of 14.73% in the week ending May 23, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), reflecting the impact of the economic slowdown.

When asked if there was a risk that India’s unemployment situation could worsen over the coming year, more than 85%, or 25 of 29 respondents, said it was high, including four who said very high. The remaining four said the risk was low.

“There is going to be a significant demand shock to the economy, some of that could be permanent demand destruction, thereby pushing more out of the jobs market and keeping the unemployment rate elevated over the coming year,” said Prakash Sakpal, senior Asia economist at ING.

The Reserve Bank of India has kept its monetary policy loose, including several liquidity measures, and was expected to stay on an easy course for this fiscal year.

While calls have increased for more fiscal stimulus to speed up the economic healing, the government has limited space to respond to challenges posed by the health crisis.



“If the Indian government increases spending … it will probably prevent a loss in economic output in the short term, but this simultaneously puts more pressure on the sustainability of debt in the longer term, essentially mortgaging their future,” said Rabobank’s Eijkelenburg.

“India’s policymakers find themselves between a rock and a hard place when it comes to decisions on additional fiscal stimulus.”"

"60b12dfc1fea113390c81d92","The pandemic crushed new-vehicle sales last year in the United States, with behemoths like Ford Motor, General Motors and Honda all posting double-digit sales declines. Altogether, the sales slide reached 15 percent, with under 14.5 million new cars hitting American roads, down from a five-year average of around 17 million.

But Mazda — the 13th-ranked carmaker in America — was one of just three to increase sales last year. (Tesla and Volvo were the others.)

The critical accolades piled up, as well. U.S. News and World Report, for the fifth year, made Mazda its Best Car Brand. Every one of its new models that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tested was a Top Safety Pick, more than any other brand. It ranked No. 1 in a Consumer Reports survey on the most reliable new vehicles. And then this year, Mazda received the top spot in that magazine’s coveted Brand Report Card, based on a combined score that measures “road-test performance, predicted reliability, owner satisfaction and safety.”

“During the pandemic, a number of brands were able to take some advantage of getting people to take a look at them,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, an automotive research and consulting firm. “Mazda has had a little bit of an easier time succeeding because, with just 2 percent of the market, they haven’t had a lot to lose.”

Mr. Edwards, whose firm conducts hundreds of thousands of in-depth surveys with new car buyers each year, attributed part of Mazda’s appeal during this atypical period to consumer perceptions held by its typical buyers. Just as car shoppers are attracted to Jeeps for the perception of go-anywhere ability, and to BMWs for the idea of being able to drive at top speed on the autobahn — even if these things never actually happen to an ordinary owner — consumers were attracted to Mazda during the pandemic because the brand offered them a fantasy of carefree relief.

“Mazda owners tend to be younger, single college graduates. They have an income that’s slightly higher than the general population, and they’re less likely to have kids. They enjoy fine dining. They travel the world,” he said. “So everything that we weren’t able to do this year, this is what Mazda owners love to do. That’s part of the brand imagery.”

And driving was the next-best thing. “Mazdas have this image of being an escape,” Mr. Edwards added.

In addition, though it has a cadre of loyalists, Mazda relies heavily on “conquest” sales — luring consumers from other brands — to fuel sales growth. During the pandemic, as potential car buyers navigated closed dealerships, dived deeper into online reviews and embraced at-home test drives, the small Japanese marque made its move.

“With all of the rules being rewritten, they were able to pick up additional people that were reconsidering what vehicles they were going to consider,” Mr. Edwards said.

For years, Mazda sported best-in-class fuel economy across its entire range, but it may be best known for its zippy $26,830 MX-5 Miata roadster. The Miata, one of the few affordable two-seat sports cars still on the market, is an industry benchmark for the cost/fun-to-drive ratio.

So far in the month of May, the auto fuel prices have been hiked 14 times after oil marketing companies (OMCs) resumed their price revisions ending an 18-day hiatus that coincided with the assembly elections in key states.


With the recent hikes this month, petrol prices have already crossed the Rs 100-mark in several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra including the capital cities – Bhopal and Jaipur, and now Mumbai too is on the verge of hitting the historic landmark.

Fuel prices in the country differ from state to state depending on the local taxation (VAT) and freight charges. Apart from this, the central government charges an excise duty on auto fuels.

The central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. Centre levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.



Petrol and diesel prices generally get revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

"60b12f421fea113390c81d95","Japan’s unemployment rate crept up and job availability slid in April, data showed on Friday, underscoring the pain the country’s prolonged battle with Covid-19 is inflicting on the economy.

Separate data showed core consumer prices in Tokyo fell in May, reinforcing expectations inflation will remain well below the central bank’s 2% target for the time being.

The government is looking to extend state of emergency curbs to combat at the pandemic by about three weeks to June 20, a cabinet minister said on Friday, clouding the outlook for the fragile recovery.

Japan’s jobless rate rose to 2.8% in April from 2.6% in March, government data showed on Friday, exceeding a median market forecast of 2.7%.

The jobs-to-applicants ratio stood at 1.09, down from the previous month’s 1.10, which was also the Reuters poll forecast.

“Job offers may have dipped again in May due to the third round of emergency declarations. That may further hold back the recovery in employment,” said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics. “But further ahead we still expect both employment and the labour force to return to pre-virus levels in the second half of the year as vaccines allow the economy to return to full health.”

Core consumer prices in Tokyo, considered a leading indicator of nationwide figures, fell 0.2% in May from a year earlier, separate data showed on Friday, matching a median market estimate.

Japan’s economy shrank in the first quarter and many analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as renewed state of emergency curbs hurt consumption.

Weak domestic demand has stoked fears of a return to deflation even as other major economies see inflation tick up, keeping the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain massive stimulus.

The expected extension of state of emergency curbs to combat Covid-19 heightens the chance the BOJ will push back the current September deadline for a package of measures to cushion the economic blow from the health crisis."

"60b12fcc1fea113390c81d97","Divestment-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) said on Thursday it is not considering reducing its stake in Petronet LNG (PLL) or Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) to prevent a new owner from having to make an open offer to minority investors in both companies.

Current Sebi regulations would require that the acquirer of the state-owned refiner make an open offer to minority shareholders of Petronet LNG and IGL due to its promoter status. However, BPCL is working with the government to exempt a new owner from this requirement.

“BPCL has no intention to pare its stake, in either PLL or IGL,” said N Vijayagopal, Director (Finance), BPCL, adding that such a move would lead to value destruction for both BPCL as well as Petronet LNG and IGL. BPCL holds a 12.5 per cent stake in Petronet LNG, India’s largest LNG importer, and a 22.5 per cent stake in city gas distribution company IGL.

“This order of asset price inflation in the context of the estimated 8 per cent contraction in GDP in 2020-21 poses the risk of a bubble,” the RBI said.

The central bank had raised the stock market bubble issue last year also when stock prices skyrocketed.

“India’s equity prices also surged to record highs, with the benchmark index (Sensex) crossing 50,000 mark on January 21, 2021 to touch a peak of 52,154 on February 15, 2021, which represents a 100.7 per cent increase from the slump just before beginning of the nationwide lockdown (i.e., since March 23, 2020) and a 68.0 per cent increase over the year 2020-21,” the RBI’s Annual Report for 2020-21 said.



On August 22, 2020, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said there was a clear disconnect between the sharp surge in markets and the state of real economy, as surplus global liquidity was driving up asset prices worldwide."
"60b130641fea113390c81d99","The foreign exchange transactions of the central bank have come as a saviour for the government even as the Covid pandemic continues to rage across the country. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been able to transfer a higher amount to the government as surplus this year following a sharp fall in provisions and gains from foreign exchange transactions during the year ended March 2021.

The central bank’s gain from foreign exchange transactions rose from Rs 29,993 crore to Rs 50,629 crore in 2020-21. A good chunk of the money transferred to the government was profit from the sale of dollars during the last three months of FY21 — $25.94 billion in March, $24.57 billion in February and $15.37 billion in January. Last year, RBI dollar sales were just $8.03 billion in March and $1.46 billion in February.

The RBI last week decided to transfer a higher amount of Rs 99,122 crore to the government despite the year FY21 being a nine-month period as against Rs 57,127 crore in the previous 12-month period. The RBI move, which is likely to boost the government’s finances, comes at a time when the real economy indicators moderated through April-May 2021 as the second wave of Covid-19 took a heavy toll. “While the economy has not moderated to the extent during the first wave, the surrounding uncertainties can act as a deterrent in the immediate period,” RBI said in its Annual Report for 2020-21, while expecting a 10.5 per cent growth in 2021-22.

EXPLAINED
Profit from sale of dollars
A good chunk of the money transferred to the government was profit from sale of dollars in last 3 months of FY21 — $25.94 billion in March, $24.57 billion in February and $15.37 billion in January.

Going ahead, as the vaccination drive picks up and cases of infections fall, a sharp turnaround in growth is likely, supported by strong favourable base effects, it said. “In the midst of the second wave as 2021-22 commences, pervasive despair is being lifted by cautious optimism built up by vaccination drives,” the central bank said.

The central bank said the rupee gained by 3.5 per cent (based on USD/rupee closing rates as at end-March 2021 over end-March 2020) but underperformed vis-a-vis its Asian peers during 2020-21. In Q4 of 2020-21, while the Indian rupee remained supported by foreign portfolio flows and merchant-related inflows, aiding the RBI to sell dollars at a gain, dollar purchases almost matched sales.


Under Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, after making provisions for bad and doubtful debts, depreciation in assets, contribution to staff and superannuation funds and for all matters for which provisions are to be made by or under the Act or that are usually provided by bankers, the balance of the profits of the Reserve Bank is required to be paid to the central government.

According to the RBI report, in India, the pace of contagion of the second wave has been alarming, stretching health infrastructure.



The onset of the second wave has triggered a raft of revisions to growth projections, with the consensus gravitating towards the Reserve Bank’s projection of 10.5 per cent for the year 2021-22 with 26.2 per cent growth in Q1, 8.3 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 6.2 per cent in Q4.

The size of the RBI balance sheet increased by 6.99 per cent from Rs 53,34,792 crore as on June 30, 2020 to Rs 57,07,669 crore as on March 31, 2021, the report said.

According to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Annual Report, during 2020-21, the number of card payment transactions carried out through credit cards and debit cards decreased by 19 per cent and 20.6 per cent, respectively.

This resulted in a decrease in value of credit card transactions by 13.7 per cent and debit card transactions by 5.9 per cent during the same period, the RBI said.

The total value of credit and debit card transactions fell from Rs 14,34,814 crore to Rs 12,93,822 crore during 2020-21, the RBI said.

The RBI report said Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) recorded contraction in volume by 7.4 per cent during the year as against a growth of 15.7 per cent a year ago, while the transaction value at 1.97 lakh crore was lower by 8.3 per cent vis-à-vis last year.

The number of Points of Sale (PoS) terminals increased by 6.5 per cent to 47.20 lakh and the number of Bharat Quick Response (BQR) codes deployed increased by 76.0 per cent to 35.70 lakh as at end-March 2021.

Further, the number of ATMs marginally increased by 2.0 per cent from 2.34 lakh at end-March 2020 to 2.38 lakh at end-March 2021, the RBI said.

Overall, the total digital transaction volume in 2020-21 stood at 4,371 crore as against 3,412 crore in 2019-20, attesting to the resilience of the digital payment system in the face of the pandemic, the RBI said.

The share of digital transactions in the total volume of non-cash retail payments increased to 98.5 per cent during 2020- 21, up from 97.0 per cent in the previous year, it said.

“Besides augmenting the broad-based use of technology, the pandemic has fuelled the proliferation of digital modes of payment, propelling the country towards ‘less-cash’ alternatives,” the RBI said. Digital transactions recovered from their lows in the months of the lockdown and gained traction over the rest of the year with a growing preference for contactless transactions and tailored financial offerings by fintech players to adapt to the needs of end-users, it said.

According to the RBI, transactions through National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system rose by 12.7 per cent during the year. At the end of March 2021, the NEFT facility was available through 1,75,283 branches of 225 banks.



Further, the banknotes in circulation have been growing along with the rise in digital payments. The volume of banknotes in circulation has doubled in the last decade, from 5,654.9 crore pieces in 2009-10 to 11,597.7 crore pieces in 2019-20 and reached 12,436.7 crore pieces as on March 31, 2021, the RBI said."

"60b1313a1fea113390c81d9c","Bank fixed deposits and small savings schemes are some of the most popular low-risk investment options in our country, particularly among risk-averse investors. When investing in a low-risk investment instrument, investors usually look for features like the safety of the fund, returns potential, the minimum and maximum size of investment allowed, tax benefits, liquidity, and tenure options. While fixed deposits are offered by all the banks in the country, small savings schemes are operated by the Union government and are available in multiple variants including the Public Provident Fund, Post Office Time Deposits, National Savings Scheme, National Savings Certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, Senior Citizens Savings Scheme, etc. with varying terms and conditions and investment objectives.

But what should be your investment choice between bank FDs and small savings schemes? Let’s find out.

Safety of investment
Bank FDs and small savings schemes both offer safety of funds to their investors. Banks are known to provide moderate returns on deposits along with high capital safety. Deposits with stable, well-capitalised banks are highly safe. Investments in small savings schemes are also highly safe because of the sovereign guarantee of the government of India. They are therefore almost risk-free.

Interest rates
Post office time deposits are currently offering interest rates in the range of 5.50 per cent p.a. to 6.70 per cent p.a. for 1 year to 5 years’ tenures. The NSC and the SCSS, which have a maturity period of 5 years, are currently offering 6.80 per cent and 7.40 per cent p.a. respectively. On the other hand, most bank FDs for non-senior-citizen depositors amounting to less than Rs 1 crore are currently offering interest rates in the range of 4.25 per cent to 6.50 per cent p.a. while a few private and small finance banks are offering slightly higher rates up to 7.25 per cent p.a. for tenures between 1 to 5 years.

Small savings schemes with more than five years’ maturity periods such as PPF, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, and KVP (which comes with a maturity period of 124 months) are currently offering 7.10 per cent, 7.60 per cent, and 6.90 per cent p.a., respectively. But most bank FDs with a maturity of more than 5 years are offering interest in the range of 4.80 per cent to 6.50 per cent p.a.

So, small savings schemes offer a better interest rate than bank FDs in most cases. However, banks allow investment options with more flexibility in the choice of tenures, and they also allow investments for ultra-short tenures ranging between 7 days to 1 year. Also, senior citizen FD investors usually get preferential rates up to 50 basis points over and above the applicable normal rates.

Liquidity and loan facility
Most small saving schemes come with a lock-in stipulation except post office time deposits. On the other hand, bank FDs allow premature partial or complete withdrawal benefits that can be availed after losing a small portion of the interest income as penalty. So, bank FDs usually offer greater liquidity compared to the small savings schemes with the exception of tax-saving FDs that come with a mandatory lock-in period of 5 years.

And as far as borrowing facility is concerned, both bank FDs and small savings schemes can be used as a pledge to get a loan subject to terms and conditions.

Fixed returns throughout investment tenure
As the name suggests, fixed deposit schemes of banks allow investors to get the same interest rate throughout the investment period, which is set when initiating the deposit. Small savings schemes like post office time deposits, NSC, and KVP also allow the same interest rate throughout the investment period. However, interest in schemes like PPF and SSY keep changing for existing and new investments whenever there is a change in interest rate by the government. The interest rates on small savings schemes are revised every quarter.

Tax benefits
Tax-saver bank FDs allow tax deduction benefit up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the I-T Act; however, they don’t allow premature withdrawals, loans, or overdrafts against them. Small savings schemes like PPF and NSC also allow tax benefits u/s 80C to their investors who can also get a loan against them subject to fulfilment of conditions. But normal bank FDs do not come with any tax deduction benefits. Plus, their interest income is taxed according to the slab rate applicable to the investor. However, while the interest income from small savings schemes like PPF and SSY are tax-exempt, NSC, KVP and five-year post office time deposit returns are taxable.

Riders on investment amount
There is an upper limit on maximum investment into small saving schemes like PPF and SSY. You can’t invest more than Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year in them. In NSC, you can invest more than Rs 1.5 lakh, but the tax benefit is not available on the excess amount. The total investment threshold is Rs 15 lakh in SCSS. However, there is no upper limit when you invest in a bank FD or a post office fixed deposit scheme.

Final thoughts
Small savings schemes come in multiple variants including some that may not be suitable for every investor. For example, only parents with young daughters are eligible for SSY while resident individuals above the age of 60 can invest in SCSS. However, schemes like PPF and SSY usually offer higher interest rates than prevailing bank FD rates and their returns are highly tax-efficient as well. But they do have long lock-in requirements and restrictions on investment amount. Bank FDs, on the other hand, are highly liquid and there’s no ceiling on maximum investment amount, but their post-tax returns are much lower. So, you must carefully evaluate your financial goals and invest, in a diversified manner, in instruments that are aligned with your returns expectations, risk appetite and liquidity requirements.

"60b131c91fea113390c81d9d","While Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga insists the games will go ahead, he looks set to extend a virus emergency until the middle of June, barely a month before the Olympics are due to start. Analysts factoring in a longer emergency now see a larger chance of Japan suffering a second straight quarterly contraction.

A last-minute ditching of the games on top of an extended emergency would inflict extra pain on the economy, slowing a hoped-for recovery in the summer and knocking back growth this year by as much as 1.7 percentage point, according to Bloomberg Economics’ Yuki Masujima.

 Source: Bloomberg
“Cancellation of the Olympics would result from the virus situation deteriorating further and that’s what would have the wider impact on the economy,” said Masujima, whose baseline scenario is that the games will take place.

Other economists focusing on the direct impact of a scrapped games see a smaller hit to the economy. Some say that going ahead with the event could also put the economy at risk if it contributes to an acceleration of infections or the spread of new variants.

While Japan won plaudits for containing virus cases in the first phase of the Covid crisis, it’s now paying the price for a slow vaccine rollout as it keeps extending its emergency restrictions to stem the pressure on its medical system from high infection numbers.

Amid the ongoing virus emergency, the debate over whether the games should proceed is intensifying. Recent opinion polls show a majority of the public against staging the Olympics this year and a number of prominent business leaders have called into question the wisdom of pressing ahead. The Asahi Shimbun, one of the nation’s biggest daily newspapers and a sponsor of the event, weighed in on Wednesday, calling for the games to be shelved.

Some teams have canceled training camps in Japan over virus concerns. The U.S. national track & field team has scrapped its training in Chiba prefecture near Tokyo. The Australian rugby sevens team has called off its planned training in Odawara, the Sankei newspaper reported Wednesday.

If a cancellation of the games occurs, economists agree it would come at a bad time when the economy is struggling to recover.

“We shouldn’t be judging whether to hold the Olympics based on its economic impact,” said Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. “If the event can be done without causing any trouble for the medical system dealing with Covid, then we should do it. If not, we shouldn’t.”

Cancellation would cause a direct economic loss of about 1.4 trillion yen ($12.9 billion), according to Nagahama. That compares with a 1.8 trillion yen estimate by Takahide Kiuchi at Nomura Research Institute Ltd., based mainly on lost consumption.

Kiuchi warns that the economic damage could end up much bigger in the opposite scenario where the games trigger another spike in infections, causing another virus emergency.

“The economic benefit of the event itself isn’t that big at this stage,” Kiuchi said. “If going ahead with the games raises the infection risk, that will have a lot of downsides economically.”

Not everyone sees a need to factor in the fate of the Games into growth calculations for the year.

Kazuma Maeda, an economist at Barclays Securities, sees downside risks for the economy mounting and an emergency extension causing a bigger contraction this quarter. But the key to the recovery isn’t the Olympics, he said.

“It’s progress in vaccinations that’s the focal point for the mindset of consumers” rather than the Olympics, he said. “I think that’s more important.”"

In the national capital, the petrol price rose by 24 paise while that of diesel too inched up 29 paise.

Following the latest price revision, petrol in Delhi is now retailing at Rs 93.68 a litre while diesel is selling at Rs 84.61. In the financial capital Mumbai, petrol price neared the Rs 100-mark and now stands at Rs 99.94 while diesel costs Rs 91.87, data available on Indian Oil Corporation’s website showed.

With the recent hikes this month, petrol prices have already crossed the Rs 100-mark in several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Earlier this month, Bhopal became the first state capital to have petrol hit the three-figure mark and today Jaipur touched the historic milestone after petrol price reached Rs 100.17 per litre.

Today’s fuel price hike marks the 14th occasion in the ongoing month after oil marketing companies (OMCs) resumed their price revisions ending an 18-day hiatus that coincided with the assembly elections in key states. During this period, petrol price has increased by Rs 3.28 per litre and diesel has climbed by Rs 3.88 in New Delhi.

In India, the fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the local taxation (VAT) and freight charges. Apart from this, the central government charges an excise duty on auto fuels.

The central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. Centre levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.



Petrol and diesel prices generally get revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

In the international market, oil prices fell on Thursday but stayed within the tight range they have been in all week, as optimism on the summer driving season in the United States and Europe offset concerns about demand in India and a potential supply increase from Iran, news agency Reuters reported.

Brent crude fell 44 cents (0.6 per cent) to $68.43 a barrel at 0220 GMT, erasing Wednesday’s gain of 22 cents. Brent has traded between $68 and $69 for most of this week. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 43 cents (0.7 per cent) to $65.78 a barrel, after a rise of 14 cents on Wednesday, but still in the $65-$66 range it has been this week, the report said.

"60b132c21fea113390c81d9f","To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, the second wave of which has seen an unprecedented loss of lives and livelihood, Uday Kotak, CII president and a leading industry voice, has called for strong fiscal support measures from the government — from income support to individuals to an additional emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) for the stressed MSME sector.

Kotak, MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank, also emphasised the “need to be very cautious” about opening up the economy even after June, calling it a “very difficult dilemma” for states, and saying a lot depends on the progress made on the vaccination front.

“I believe the time has come for the state to get more active and I would strongly support fiscal support coming in for protecting livelihood and minimum requirements of individuals and households. I am quite comfortable if we go and spend from the fisc and expand the position. There is absolutely no issue as I see it and that’s what we need to do… Time may have come for the government to be looking at an additional ECLGS scheme, including increasing the size from Rs 3 lakh crore to Rs 4-5 lakh crore,” said Kotak.

On May 13 last year, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free automatic loans for businesses, including MSMEs, at concessional rates.

Calling for fiscal support to the lower end of the economy, be it in the form of direct benefit transfer or ECLGS scheme for small and medium businesses, Kotak said, “At CII, we support fiscal support to the lower end of the economy… We need to do what it takes. We will figure out how we manage our books down the road but right now, we have to ensure that the economy remains in reasonable shape in the next six to nine months,” he said.

Even as some state governments consider relaxing lockdowns amid a dip in cases, Kotak said he feels the “need to be very cautious on that front” and that opening up even after June is a “very difficult dilemma” that state administrations and individuals face.

Stating that the answer to that is linked to vaccination, he said, “We are probably three to four months away from being fully convinced that a large part of the population is vaccinated or has become Covid-proof…. If we can vaccinate a significant number of the population by September or so, then the question is hanging in (for) the interim period of three months… I think I would do it in a very careful, calibrated manner, rather than rushing in to open up,” said Kotak, adding that the country must be prepared for a third wave of the infection.

Earlier, in April, as states started announcing weekend lockdowns or curfews, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said, “Even with the second wave, we are very clear that we are not going in for lockdowns in a big way. We don’t want to totally arrest the economy.”

On the much more debilitating second wave, Kotak pointed to India declaring victory “too early” and being caught unawares by the new variant of Covid-19.

“We, as a nation and each one of us, lowered our guard. By January, we declared victory and we started going out, holding meetings, saw gathering of crowds, social activity and whole host of things across the nation. We probably declared victory a little early.”

Incidentally, even as the Centre decided not to announce a nationwide lockdown, the CII took a decision in the first week of May, urging the industry to voluntarily curb non-essential economic activities over the next two weeks in a bid to break the chain of transmission.

Kotak said the call was based on feedback from members of the CII across the country. He pointed to the fact that in his company itself, the number of lives lost between April and May was 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the whole of last year.



“On our side, our call was very simple. The employee balance sheet is more important than financial balance sheet… As far as Central and state governments are concerned, it is up to them to have taken a call… and so, it really depends on them how they saw the situation across their different parts,” he said.

Kotak took over as CII president on June 2 last year. His term comes to an end on May 31, with T V Narendran, MD, Tata Steel taking over on June 1."
"60b133061fea113390c81da0","The country’s aviation safety regulator has cautioned Indian airline operators of the incident in Belarus, where a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was made to force land in Minsk, allegedly to arrest a dissident journalist on board. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has told airlines to “monitor the situation” as a number of airlines have started re-routing their flights to avoid Belarusian airspace.

Several European airlines including Lufthansa, KLM, Finnair and AirBaltic have started skirting Belarusian airspace. Vistara and Air India fly over Belarus for their flights to Europe. As per Flightradar24, Vistara flies over Belarus on its flights from Delhi to London, while Air India uses the airspace to fly to London, Frankfurt, etc. “Please ensure fuel planning, (and) take into account a last moment re-route in case overflying Belarus airspace,” DGCA is learnt to have told airlines.

As per Flightradar24: “Most flights that use Belarus’ airspace are just passing through. Since downing of MH17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014, airlines have avoided airspace there, moving flights that would transit Ukraine if on an optimal routing north to Belarus. Most flights transiting Belarus are flying between western Europe and either Russia or Southeast Asia”.

The arrest of journalist Roman Protasevich has resulted in international bodies reprimanding Belarus. He had taken a Ryanair flight for the 3-hour long journey. However, when the plane approached the border between Lithuania and Belarus, a MiG-29 fighter intercepted it, and made it land in Minsk. Ryanair said its crew was “notified by Belarus (Air Traffic Control) of a potential security threat on board and were instructed to divert to Minsk”.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) — the UN’s specialised agency for civil aviation — said: “ICAO is strongly concerned by the apparent forced landing of a Ryanair flight and its passengers, which could be in contravention of the Chicago Convention. We look forward to more information being officially confirmed by the countries and operators concerned”. It added ICAO’s Council President has called an urgent meeting of the 36 diplomatic representatives to the council on May 27."
"60b133431fea113390c81da1","India’s economic activity showed signs of beginning to cool off in April as several states resorted to lockdowns to control a deadly second wave of the coronavirus.

Although the three-month weighted average scores of eight indicators tracked by Bloomberg News showed the pace of activity was unchanged from March, the single month reading pointed to weakness setting in.

 Source: Bloomberg
Even more recent data from this month confirmed the softening trend in activity. A basket of high-frequency, alternative and market indicators such as retail activity and road congestion pointed to weakness in the week to May 16, Abhishek Gupta, India economist at Bloomberg Economics, said in a report.

Here’s more India data worth tracking in the days ahead:

— Goods and services tax data released by the Finance Ministry around the first week of every month is a key indicator of consumption
— Surveys of purchasing managers by IHS Markit, also out next week, will offer an early glimpse of manufacturing and services activity
— Auto sales published by companies such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. and Hero MotoCorp Ltd. on the first day of every month serve as an indicator of demand
— Unemployment rate for April from private research firm Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. will also be out early next week, serving as a window on the labor market in the absence of real-time official data

The growing economic pain may render next week’s gross domestic product numbers a sideshow. Data on Monday will probably show the economy grew near about 1% from a year earlier in the March quarter, and faster than the 0.4% expansion in the prior three months, before India became the global hotspot for virus infections.

Business Activity
Activity in India’s dominant services sector moderated for a second straight month in April. The IHS Markit India Services PMI eased to 54 from 54.6, with a reading above 50 signaling growth. A similar survey for the manufacturing sector showed expansion picking up just a tad.

 Source: Bloomberg
At the same time, input costs have been rising with implications for headline inflation. That is likely to come up for discussion at next week’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting to decide interest rates.

Exports
Exports soared in April, mainly because of a low base the year earlier when a nationwide lockdown crippled economic activity. Shipments jumped 196%, while imports increased 167% year-on-year. Sequentially though, both measures moderated.

 Source: Bloomberg
Consumer Activity
Google mobility indicators exhibited a dip across all major cities in April as compared to the baseline. E-way bills — an indicator of domestic trade — recorded double digit contraction at 17.5% month-on-month in April — and possibly pointing to a moderation in goods and services tax collections.

Most passenger vehicle manufacturers reported a month-on-month dip in April, reflecting subdued demand. Dispatches of two wheelers contracted by double-digits, mirroring frail rural demand. Tractor sales weakened amid supply chain constraints and dwindling footfalls at dealerships.

Bank credit grew 5.7% in April from a year earlier, picking up from 5.6% expansion seen in March, central bank data showed. Liquidity conditions stayed comfortable, with the banking system in surplus.

 Source: Bloomberg
Industrial Activity
Industrial production expanded, jumping 22.4% in March from a year earlier, mainly because of a favorable base. But numbers for April are likely at risk from activity curbs because of state-level lockdowns.

Output at infrastructure industries, which makes up 40% of the industrial production index, expanded 6.8% in March from a year ago. Both data are published with a one-month lag."
"60b3589459458642809a5309","Twitter is working on a host of new features, many of which will focus on monetisation strategies for content creators and the social media platform. The company has already rolled out a tip jar for select accounts, and it is also working on a new ‘subscription’ feature called Twitter Blue.

Now, reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who is known for revealing app features before they are announced, has given a glimpse of what this subscription service will look like and might cost. According to her tweet, Twitter Blue will cost $2.99 per month, and it will be offered as an in-app purchase feature on the App Store.

What will Twitter Blue offer
As revealed by Wong, Twitter Blue will have some special features such as the ability to undo a tweet, Collections where users can see all their favourite tweets in one place and a reader mode as well. The last one on the list is coming soon, it would seem.

It will also offer more themes and colour schemes for users, who are paying to use the service. Custom app icons will also be offered as the screenshots reveal.

Twitter Blue: What else do we know so far
One of the most important features will be the ability to undo a tweet. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has made it clear in the past that they won’t offer an edit button for tweets, but this undo option can be seen as a tradeoff of sorts.

As Bloomberg reported earlier this year, Twitter confirmed that its subscription product will also let people charge followers to access special content. So a creator or independent journalist or celebrity could also charge people in order to access select paid content on the platform. This is a strategy that more and more social media platforms might deploy in the future given the success of sites like OnlyFans, Patreon, which offer a subscription-based model for creators.

Twitter also plans to introduce a new feature called “Super Follows,” as part of this subscription model. The content could range from exclusive tweets to audio conversations to even paid newsletters.

Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter’s head of product, revealed that the company plans to roll out Super Follows “sometime this year,” though it is not clear whether the feature will be limited to the US market initially.  Bloomberg reported that Twitter could also charge for features such as an-free feed, Tweetdeck, higher-quality audio, and perhaps in-depth analytics.

Twitter and newsletters
In January, Twitter also confirmed its purchase of newsletter startup Revue.  According to the company blog post, Twitter said that writers, experts and curators, especially those creating long-form content “are a valuable part of the conversation” and it wants to offer them news way to build their audience and earn revenue.  The Revue deal is part of these efforts as outlined in the blog.

Twitter says the idea is to help “writers connect with their subscribers, while also helping readers better discover writers and their content,” while helping them generate revenue. It has also made Revue’s Pro features free for all accounts and lowered the paid newsletter fee to 5 per cent, which it says will ensure writers can “keep more of the revenue generated from subscriptions.”

“We will continue to invest in Revue as a standalone service, and its team will remain focused on improving the ways writers create their newsletters, build their audience and get paid for their work. We’re also expanding their team and hiring for key roles across engineering, design, research and data science,” the blog post added."
"60b358f559458642809a530a","Apple Inc is readying a revamp of its entry-level AirPods for this year and a second generation of the AirPods Pro for next year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The new base AirPods will mark the first update to the product since March 2019 and will add a new design that mostly mirrors that of the AirPods Pro. The earbuds will come with a new case and shorter stems poking out of the bottom of each one. The AirPods Pro coming next year will be the first change to that product since October 2019 and will include updated motion sensors with a focus on fitness tracking, the people said, asking not to be named because the plans are private.

Apple had previously aimed to release the new AirPods Pro as early as this year, Bloomberg News reported in 2020. The update to its wireless earbuds range will bolster the company’s wearables, home and accessories segment, which has grown rapidly to now account for more than $30 billion in annual revenue, exceeding 10% of total sales.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The last AirPods-related hardware introduction from Apple was the over-ear AirPods Max headphones in December. That $549 pair earned criticism for bugs and its high price but praise for its materials and sound. Apple only recently caught up with demand for the product, and it is not currently working on a second generation of the AirPods Max, though it has discussed launching additional color variations in the future.

As part of its broader home, audio and accessories strategy, Apple has also begun early development of a HomePod speaker with a built-in screen as well as a device that combines the features of a HomePod, FaceTime camera and Apple TV, Bloomberg News has reported. Competition for speakers with screens is already widespread. Apple released a HomePod mini speaker last year and outlined a minor update to the Apple TV set-top box last month.

For the new AirPods Pro, Apple has also tested a smaller design that eliminates the stems. That look will debut on new Beats-branded wireless earbuds planned to be announced next month."
"60b3593759458642809a530b","OnePlus Nord CE 5G and OnePlus TV U1S are all set to launch in India on June 10. Ahead of the launch, the company has confirmed the sale and pre-order date for the upcoming OnePlus products. The devices will be available for purchase through Amazon and OnePlus.in. The pre-order window for the OnePlus Nord CE 5G will open on June 11, but it will only be accessible to the Red Cable members.

The new mid-range phone will go on open sale on June 16, as per the timeline details published on the company’s official site. Those who are interested in the OnePlus TV U1S will be able to buy it on June 11. All the Red Cable members will be able to buy the Smart TV a day earlier, meaning on June 10.

The upcoming OnePlus Nord CE 5G is said to be a successor to the OnePlus Nord N10 5G smartphone, which was launched in Europe and North America last year. The new phone is expected to offer the same design with a punch-hole display. There could be a circular cutout on the front featuring a selfie camera.

The OnePlus Nord CE 5G is also said to sport a side-mounted fingerprint scanner and a triple rear camera setup. It will likely feature a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. OnePlus is promising that this will be a “product that is focused on delivering the core excellent features needed in a device while also bringing the signature Nord experience to users.”



If rumours are to be believed, the device will be cheaper than the original OnePlus Nord. Currently, the company is selling this mid-range phone with a starting price of Rs 25,000. The mentioned price is for the 64GB storage model.

As for the OnePlus TV U1S, it is said to arrive with support for HDR10+, HLG, and MEMC, along with a 60Hz display. It could feature 30W speakers with support for Dolby Audio, co-tuned with Dynaudio. The company might offer the new Smart TV in three sizes, including 50-inch, 55-inch, and 65-inch. The rest of the details are currently under wraps."
"60b3596c59458642809a530c","The group behind the SolarWinds cyber attack identified late last year is now targeting government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organisations, Microsoft Corp said late on Thursday.

“This week we observed cyberattacks by the threat actor Nobelium targeting government agencies, think tanks, consultants, and non-governmental organisations”, Microsoft said in a blog. Nobelium, originating from Russia, is the same actor behind the attacks on SolarWinds customers in 2020, according to Microsoft.

“This wave of attacks targeted approximately 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organisations”, Microsoft said.

While organisations in the United States received the largest share of attacks, targeted victims came from at least 24 countries, Microsoft said. At least a quarter of the targeted organisations were involved in international development, humanitarian issues and human rights work, Microsoft said in the blog.

Nobelium launched this week’s attacks by breaking into an email marketing account used by the United States Agency For International Development (USAID) and from there launching phishing attacks on many other organisations, Microsoft said.

The hack of information technology company SolarWinds, which was identified in December, gave access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products.

Microsoft President Brad Smith described the attack as “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen”.This month, Russia’s spy chief denied responsibility for the SolarWinds cyber attack but said he was “flattered” by the accusations from the United States and Britain that Russian foreign intelligence was behind such a sophisticated hack.

The United States and Britain have blamed Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), successor to the foreign spying operations of the KGB, for the hack which compromised nine US federal agencies and hundreds of private sector companies.

The attacks disclosed by Microsoft on Thursday appeared to be a continuation of multiple efforts to target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts, Microsoft said.

The company said it was in the process of notifying all of its targeted customers and had “no reason to believe” these attacks involved any exploitation or vulnerability in Microsoft’s products or services."
"60b359a759458642809a530d","Twitter recently introduced its audio chat rooms called Spaces, and it is now available on both the mobile and desktop browser. If you have more than 600 followers on Twitter, then you can host a Space right now. The feature is available within the app and is accessible to both Android and iOS users.

All Spaces are public and anyone can join any Space as a listener. If you create a Space or are a speaker in one of the events, then your followers will get to see it at the top of their timeline (in their Fleets). Users can also send invites to people asking them to join a Space.

You can send the link via DM or tweet the link out to your Home timeline. The microblogging site even allows you to copy the invite link and share it anywhere else.

How to create Twitter Spaces?
Step 1: Open Twitter on a web browser and then tap on the profile picture located in the top left corner.

Step 2: Scroll to the right until you find the ‘Spaces’ option.

Step 3: Once you find it, tap on it and choose your audio room audience. Here, you get three options to choose from, including Everyone, People you follow, or Only people you invite to speak.

Step 4: Once you have selected, you then tap on the “Start your Space” button. Twitter allows you to add as many as 10 speakers to a Space and you can even add
description of the event.

How to join Spaces?
Twitter Spaces automatically appear at the top of your Home timeline, where you see Fleets. All you need to do is tap on the profile of the person who is hosting a Space and then tap again on Join this Space.

You will then be added to that particular Space. If you wish to share your opinion, then you can ask for mic access from the host. Once you get the access, you are all set. Each Space has a link that one can also share publicly.

"60b359e859458642809a530e","Google is gradually adding more features to its Messages app. The company recently added support for scheduled messages, and now it is expected to add two more features. XDA-Developers has spotted a new conversation pinning feature in the latest APK teardown. Users will soon be able to pin message threads and conversations at the top of the list.

This way users won’t have to scroll down through all the message threads and one can quickly open the pinned chat. If you are someone who sends or receives many text messages, then this could be a useful feature.

The screenshots shared by XDA suggests that users will only be able to pin up to three conversations. The company will likely change the number after a point of time. It is important to note that not all the features found in the APK teardown are officially released.

That being said, this is a basic feature, and one will find it on most messaging apps. So, Google is expected to add the conversation pinning feature to its Messages app. Apart from this, Google could also add the ability to “star” conversations. This could function similar to apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. The feature will likely allow you to bookmark specific messages so you can quickly refer back to them later.



Google is testing a lot of new features for its messaging app, and it is also expected to offer a new tablet UI, as per previous reports. In the near future, we could also see features like conversation filters and a revamped emoji menu for much easier access to GIFs and stickers.

Those who are using the beta version of the app can check out some of these features. Again, note that there is no guarantee that all the features discovered in the APK teardowns will appear in the live build."

“In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made from our apps,” said a Facebook spokeswoman in an emailed statement.

“We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge.”The rule change, first reported by Politico, comes as US President Joe Biden announced he has ordered aides to find answers to the origin of the virus.

He said on Wednesday that US intelligence agencies are pursuing rival theories potentially including the possibility of a laboratory accident in China.

Social media companies have faced pressure to combat health misinformation on their sites during the pandemic. Facebook has said it has removed more than 16 million pieces of content from its apps for breaking rules on COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation.

The company announced in February that it had expanded the types of claims it would remove from its platforms, including that the virus was man-made.

The Facebook spokeswoman said the company regularly updates the list of claims it removes based on the advice of health experts.

COVID-19 has killed more than 3.6 million people worldwide. The first reported cases emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 but the origin of the virus remains contested among experts.

Earlier this week, US government sources said a still-classified US intelligence report circulated during former President Donald Trump’s administration alleged that three researchers at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became= so ill in November 2019 that they sought hospital care. The source of that early intelligence or how reliable US agencies rate it is not known."
"60b35a4459458642809a5310","Alphabet Inc’s Google is nearing a settlement of an antitrust investigation in France over allegations it abused its power in online advertising, and will likely pay a fine and institute operational changes, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The French Competition Authority has said that Google’s tool to help websites and apps sell ads gave Google’s online ad auction system an advantage over rival exchanges, the people told the newspaper.Google offered to settle the matter by removing obstacles that it puts up against competitors, the newspaper reported.

The settlement could be among the first resolutions in a wave of new investigations or lawsuits targeting Google’s ads business, which generated $147 billion in revenue last year, more than any other internet company in the world.

Most of Google’s sales come from search and YouTube ads. But about $23 billion last year was tied to helping publishers sell ads and the connections between Google’s dueling businesses is drawing antitrust scrutiny, including calls from critics for a break-up.

The French case also alleged other forms of self-preferencing in the advertising side of Google’s business, the people told the newspaper.Google spokeswoman Leslie Pitterson did not comment on the reported settlement but said that the company’s third-party ad tech products work with both Google’s partners’ and competitors’ products.

“We continue to take in feedback and make updates to better serve users and the wider ecosystem,” she said in a statement.

If approved by the Competition Authority’s board, the deal could be announced in weeks and would be binding only in France, the newspaper said.

Texas, backed by other US states, filed a lawsuit against Google in December accusing it of breaking antitrust law in how it runs its online advertising business in a case that appears to be similar to the French allegations.

Google also is fighting lawsuits in the United States from several advertisers, rivals and publishers around the same issues."

However, shares of Dell fell 1%, while those of HP dropped as much as 6%, after both companies warned the ongoing computer chip shortage could impact their ability to meet demand for laptops this year.

“The component supply situation remains constrained,” Dell Chief Financial Officer Thomas Sweet said in post earnings call, adding that rising costs to procure these chips would hit its operating income in the current quarter by the low to mid-single digits and lead to slightly lower revenue on a sequential basis.

HP Inc, which ranks second among global PC vendors according to IDC data, said the shortages would limit its ability to supply personal computing devices and printers at least until the end of the year.Still, the companies, which are leaders in the personal computing industry, said they were bullish on the overall market, expecting the surge in demand for laptops needed by people working and going to school remotely to continue.

Global shipments of PCs, the industry’s collective term for laptops and desktops, grew 55.2% during the first quarter, according to preliminary data from research firm IDC.


Dell said revenue from its client solutions group, which includes desktops, notebooks and tablets, rose 20% to $13.31 billion in the reported quarter.

"60b35b2c59458642809a5313","Samsung has announced two new tablets that are set to go on sale in India soon. These include the Galaxy Tab S7 FE and Galaxy Tab A7 Lite. The tablets bring features from the flagship Galaxy Tab S7 to the two new affordable tablets. This is something that Samsung started implementing last year with the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE smartphone, by bringing popular features from the flagship S20 series to a more affordable device.

The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE turned out to be quite popular, and it now seems Samsung is looking to do the same with its tablets with the introduction of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE. Here is everything you should know about the new tablets from Samsung.

Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE: Specifications
The Galaxy Tab S7 FE measures 185.0 x 284.8 x 6.3mm and features a 12.4-inch (1,600×2,560 pixels) LCD display. The 5G tablet weighs in at 608g and runs on Android 11-based Samsung OneUI.

"60b35b6859458642809a5314","Nintendo has been struggling to meet demands for the Switch due to the global chip shortage. However, this hasn’t led to the brand faltering on its plans to launch a second device. The company is reportedly looking to start the production of the next-gen Nintendo Switch by July 2021.

A new report by Bloomberg also suggests that the company might flaunt the next-gen console at the E3 gaming conference this June. The report also adds that Nintendo could launch the new Switch by September this year.

Nintendo Switch 2: What to expect
The next-gen Nintendo Switch will also likely be priced higher than the current model, suggests the report. While it will eventually replace the first-gen Switch, the new console will be sold alongside the affordable Switch Lite. The report also says that Nintendo plans to ramp up production to a peak in the last quarter of 2021, despite the global semiconductor shortage.

“An upgraded Switch can be extremely valuable in extending the lifecycle of the platform. Both Sony and Microsoft have had success with mid-cycle upgrades as a means to drive growth from live services and, as this becomes a greater driver for Nintendo, not fragmenting the user base across different platforms would be advantageous,” Bloomberg analyst Matthew Kanterman said.

Talking about specifications, the new device is expected to come with a 7-inch OLED display from Samsung and an Nvidia GPU with support for 4K output. The premium components combined with the chip shortage is likely to make the price of the console go above $299 (about Rs 21,700). Note that no information on the final retail price is currently available."
"60b35bbc59458642809a5315","Recent volatility aside, the valuations and popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have been hitting record heights, and the array of avenues accepting these private cryptocurrencies as payment instruments are also on the rise. The regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies has transitioned from press releases issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) cautioning users against risks associated with private cryptocurrencies, to the RBI issuing a blanket ban on RBI-regulated entities (like banks and intermediaries) providing services to persons/settling transactions involving cryptocurrencies, to the Supreme Court of India striking down RBI’s ban as disproportionate, to the government formulating a bill (the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 that is yet to be tabled before the Parliament) to ban private cryptocurrencies. Despite the noise within government circles to ban all private cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies currently operate in India in a regulatory vacuum and transaction volumes continue to witness a massive surge.

In India, while officially the fate of private cryptocurrencies is uncertain, the Crypto Bill 2021 facilitates formulating an official/central backed digital currency that will be issued by the RBI and would be recognised as ‘tender’. Several nations across the globe have rolled out (or are designing/testing) their central backed digital currencies (like Ecuador’s Dinero Electrónico, the Swedish eKrona, and the Chinese eYuan) and have charged ahead in this space, with other intrigued nations close at their heels.

Sovereign backed digital currency and challenges
Centralised vs Decentralised and Volatility

The fundamental ethos of private cryptocurrencies is that they are private (user-driven), decentralised (without involving any regulator) and enable direct peer-to-peer transactions under the cloak of anonymity. The value of private cryptocurrencies is market-driven, and not regulated by any authority or based on the value of any currency/commodity or other underlying assets. This makes them volatile in nature and there is a general perception of these being less secure. Regulators across the globe have therefore expressed concerns vis-à-vis private cryptocurrencies primarily from the perspective of financial security, tax evasion and money laundering.

Any central backed digital currency on the other hand is a digital form of fiat currency (i.e., government-issued cash) which will be government authorised, transparent (leaving behind an electronic record/trail) and relatively less volatile. Central backed digital currencies will also further the government’s efforts towards financial inclusion and cashless/digital payments and will be interoperable between different banking systems making them safer and more reliable/resilient.

Distributed Ledger Technology/Blockchain

Private cryptocurrencies rely on the distributed ledger technology and blockchain to validate transactions. Distributed ledger technology is like a communal database accessible to all users that enables transparent validation of transactions and tracking of historical trades.

Transaction validation on the blockchain requires high electric power; which leads to payments through blockchain not being easily scalable to high transaction volumes. Additionally, there being a central validator of all transactions (in case of central backed digital currencies), would defy the very concept of a decentralised blockchain system.

Costs

Mining private cryptocurrencies require significant computing power which increases transaction costs and casts a shadow on their long-term sustainability. While central backed digital currency is touted as a cost-saving measure (from an interbank settlements perspective and given currency notes are expensive to mint and store), designing and implementation of a central backed digital currency, establishment and maintenance of the infrastructure to facilitate central backed digital currency payments will entail significant costs in a secure trusted environment.

Monetary Policy and Financial Stability

Before central backed digital currencies are operationalised, it is important to consider and evaluate their monetary, systemic, regulatory, and technological impact on the financial system. Ease of accessibility of central backed digital currencies and their safe and secure storage in a safe and resilient system protected against cyberattacks, system failures or disruptions, will also play a key role in their use/acceptance. In regulating central backed digital currencies, their usage in cross border transactions (like private cryptocurrencies which are inherently borderless) also needs to be evaluated, especially on account of the Indian Rupee otherwise not being a convertible currency.

Non-interest-bearing central backed digital currencies could primarily function like cash and serve as a medium of exchange between peer-to-peer and peer-to-business transactions. However, central backed digital currencies bearing interest at a rate set by the RBI could force commercial banks to provide more incentivised rates to attract businesses and financial institutions to stick with them. Moreover, this increased competition is likely to lower profitability for commercial banks which are already under immense pressure due to the surging non-performing assets and bad debts and in a scenario of financial stress at the macro level, businesses and financial institutions might consider holding central backed digital currencies as compared to bank deposits, as a potentially safer option.

Way Ahead
A coordinated approach should be adopted to consult with the various stakeholders (like banks, financial institutions, fintech players, payment aggregators, e-commerce platforms etc.) to not only ensure seamless integration of central backed digital currencies into the financial system but also ensure all relevant and practical perspectives have been addressed. A regulatory sandbox will also undoubtedly be helpful in formulating a more holistic approach, as relevant regulatory pitfalls/ must-haves, macroeconomic factors and procedural aspects can be taken into account while designing and implementing central backed digital currencies. Various governments recognise the enormous potential and penetration power of central backed digital currencies. The Indian government’s proposed central backed digital currency to be issued by the RBI is therefore a welcome move that will address the risks associated with private cryptocurrencies and instil trust in the public to make payments using such sovereign issued virtual currencies.

"60b35dbf59458642809a5317","WhatsApp is suing the Indian government over a ‘traceability’ clause in the new Intermediary Rules 2021, which were notified in February this year. In response, the government has called WhatsApp’s act as a one of defiance and wants them to comply. Here are the top points explaining everything to know about this latest controversy.

1) WhatsApp’s case against IT rules
As reported by indianexpress.com, WhatsApp has said that the new social media rules are unconstitutional and filed the case on May 25, incidentally it was also the last day for companies to comply with the new rules. The Facebook-owned messaging app is invoking the 2017 Justice K S Puttaswamy vs Union Of India judgment in support of its arguments.

WhatsApp wants the court to ensure the clause does not come into force, and prevent criminal liability to its employees for non compliance.


2) Traceability means End-to-End encryption won’t work
In a detailed blog post, WhatsApp has also explained that traceability will not work, arguing that breaking end-to-end encryption (E2E) would weaken user privacy on the app and stifle free speech and freedom of expression. E2E encryption is turned by default on WhatsApp for all messages.

Further, WhatsApp will have to re-engineer the app just for India, which won’t happen. If WhatsApp had to comply with the rules, it would have to create a version of the app that supports traceability and doesn’t have E2E encryption.

WhatsApp said in its blog that while it supports “reasonable and proportionate regulations”, it cannot stand for “eroding privacy for everyone, violating human rights, and putting innocent people at risk.”

3) Traceability means a lot of data collection
WhatsApp in its blog post makes it clear that in order to trace the originator of any message, it will have to keep a log of all messages. Currently, WhatsApp cannot read a user’s message given the E2E encryption.

It says tracing even one message means tracing every single message on the platform and they will have to add some sort of “permanent identity stamp” or effectively ‘fingerprint’ each message. It says that this will be the equivalent of a mass surveillance program.

4) Traceability is not foolproof
WhatsApp and internet experts have made it clear that traceability is not foolproof. Further, when users are forwarding, copying messages, finding the originator becomes difficult. WhatsApp says it might have to “turn over the names of people who shared something even if they did not create it, shared it out of concern, or sent it to check its accuracy,” which would lead to human rights violations as innocent people could end up getting caught in investigations or going to jail.

Further, even if messages are fingerprinted on WhatsApp, these techniques are not foolproof and can be easily impersonated. WhatsApp also says that “traceability” goes against the basic principles of how law enforcement and investigations work.

5) Government response to WhatsApp’s lawsuit
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY)has called WhatsApp’s refusal to comply with the new IT rules as a “clear act of defiance.” Further, it has said that the right to privacy will come with reasonable restrictions, adding that social media companies will only have to give the originator of a message in select cases and based on an order from a competent court.

The government also questioned WhatsApp’s own commitment to user privacy pointing out that the company plans to “share the data of all its users with its parent company, Facebook, for marketing and advertising purposes.”

6) IT rules on tracing originator
According to the government, tracing the first originator is only under select circumstances and they don’t want to track all messages.

Under Rule 4(2) of the guidelines, a social media intermediary could be required to trace an originator of a message or tweet or post “only for the purposes of prevention, investigation, punishment etc. of inter alia an offence relating to sovereignty, integrity and security of India, public order incitement to an offence relating to rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material punishable with imprisonment for not less than five years.”

7) Three red ticks on WhatsApp calls, messages?
There is a fake WhatsApp message going viral claiming that three red ticks will appear on messages indicating that the government is reading and recording all calls, messages on the platform. This is patently false and has been debunked earlier as well. It is best to ignore this message and not forward to others. Read more about it here.

8) Google and others on the new social media rules
The new IT rules impact all social media intermediaries and companies, not just WhatsApp or Facebook or Twitter. This includes Google as well, which is another major player in the market.

In a statement, CEO Google Sundar Pichai said the company will comply with all laws. “It’s obviously early days and our local teams are very engaged… we always respect local laws in every country we operate in and we work constructively. We have clear transparency reports, when we comply with government requests, we highlight that in our transparency reports,” he said, reported PTI.

While WhatsApp is fighting a lawsuit against the new IT rules, its parent company Facebook. “Pursuant to the IT Rules, we are working to implement operational processes and improve efficiencies. Facebook remains committed to people’s ability to freely and safely express themselves on our platform,” a spokesperson for the company said.

Twitter has issued a statement on its platform around the IT rules as well. “We, alongside many in civil society in India and around the world, have concerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules,” the statement said.

“We plan to advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government and believe it is critical to adopt a collaborative approach. We believe that it is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public,” the statement adds.

Under the new guidelines, significant social media intermediaries (those with more than 50 lakh users in India) have to appoint a resident grievance officer, a chief compliance officer and a nodal contact person. The guidelines state these employees need to be residents of India."
"60b35e0159458642809a5318","Zoom has unveiled two new features for the latest M1 Apple iPad Pro models. The new features include support for Apple’s Center Stage feature and expanded Gallery View. Zoom states that the new features will “help users better participate in calls, potentially stave off video fatigue, and better connect over Zoom.”

The new Zoom 5.6.6 update is expected to hit the App Store this week. Here are the two features explained in detail.

Support for Center Stage
Center Stage, one of the key features of the iPad Pro, lets users move around during video calls. The iPad Pro uses its large camera field of view to automatically zoom into the part of the frame where the user is, using AI to continuously track any motion. During video conferences, this gives a smooth, panning movement output, even though the device is not moving.

The new Zoom update will support the feature, and M1 iPad Pro users will now be able to make use of Center Stage on both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch variants. Center Stage will even recognise when more users join the frame and change the frame to accordingly accommodate both users in the call.

“With support for Center Stage, users can participate more naturally in Zoom video calls. They do not have to worry whether they’re out of frame during a workout, teaching a class, or celebrating with friends and family over Zoom,” the company said in a statement.

Zoom users will have an option during a Zoom video call to use Center Stage on the latest iPad Pro. Apple says that Center Stage image recognition is done on-device, and no image data is sent to the cloud. Center Stage support is currently only available on Zoom 5.6.6 or later on the 11-inch (third generation) and the 12.9-inch (fifth generation) 2021 iPad Pro.

Zoom has also expanded Gallery View across all iPad models, but those using Zoom on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can see even more of their fellow meeting participants. Previous iPad models can display up to 25 video tiles in Gallery View, but those using Zoom on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can now see up to 48 video tiles (6×8 in Landscape Mode), allowing them to better connect in large meetings.

Many iPad models are also getting expanded Gallery View, and those users will see a few additional participants on a single screen, depending on the device. To bring more or fewer people into view on any iPad, simply pinch the display with two fingers to zoom in and out. Previous and new iPad models will get expanded Gallery View based on the display size; the ability to see 48 tiles in Gallery View is currently only available on the 12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro."
"60b35e2959458642809a5319","Preparing for another set of launches, which include a new smartphone under the Nord branding as well as a smart television, OnePlus CEO and founder Pete Lau says the Covid-19 pandemic has not had a significant impact in terms of product planning and roadmap for his company.

“We are continuing with our core principles and philosophy, which in terms of what we believe creates the best possible user experience through the products that we deliver. And this is something that will be continued in the upcoming launch on June 10,” he said in response to a question from indianexpress.com during an interaction with media persons recently.

However, he said the present situation has of course had an impact on the company’s “immediate approach”. Lau added: “Our thought was, we should continue with offering the launch event, and the products, even in a difficult time and take an approach of having a light and relaxed event”. He said this approach will help the world can still have information about these products.

Lau said on June 10 OnePlus will launch a new smartphone, the Nord CE, and new TV offering in the OnePlus TV U series. OnePlus will also be expanding its truly wireless offerings this year.

Lau said the company has witnessed 200% year-on-year growth for the OnePlus Nord since its launch in July 2020. The new Nord CE will be a product that “focused on delivering the core excellent features needed in a device while also bringing the signature Nord experience to users”.

Underlining how OnePlus was prepared to strengthen manufacturing investments in India, the OnePlus CEO said he aims to “achieve 100% or close to 100% manufacturing in India for both smartphones and TVs” in the future."
"60b35f1659458642809a531a","If the answer is you, there’s a reality TV show, appropriately titled “Who Wants to Be an Astronaut?,” that you ought to apply for.

The Discovery Channel is seeking to cast about 10 would-be astronauts to compete during the series’s eight-episode run next year for a seat on a real-life trip to the International Space Station, followed by live coverage of the launch of the winner on a SpaceX rocket.

“We’d like a diverse group of people that each have their own story, why they want to go to space, why they’re worthy of going to space, what their back story is,” said Jay Peterson, president of Boat Rocker Studios, Unscripted, one of the companies producing the show for Discovery.

That person will not be the only amateur astronaut destined for the space station next year. So many tourism and entertainment efforts are preparing trips there that it could begin to look more like a soundstage for television shows and a hotel for the wealthy than an orbiting research laboratory.

Many who work in the business of space believe that is a good thing, even if trips to orbit will remain out of reach of all but the wealthiest passengers in the near term.

“This is a real inflection point, I think, with human spaceflight,” Phil McAlister, NASA’s director of commercial spaceflight development, said during a news conference this month announcing that the agency had signed an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company, to fly the first mission of private astronauts to the space station.

“I’m very bullish on the tourism market and the tourism activity,” Mr. McAlister said. “I think more people that are going to fly, they’re going to want to do more things in space.”

Although the International Space Station may stay up in orbit at least until 2028, in the future it will not be the only space station. Russian space authorities last month declared their intention to leave the I.S.S. in the coming years and build a station of their own. A Chinese orbital outpost is expected to come online in the next year or two.

Even NASA is looking for what comes next, promising support for commercial alternatives. Axiom, for one, is building a commercial segment, which will first be added to the International Space Station and later serve as a core piece of an Axiom station.

“By the end of the decade I believe we will have at least five, possibly 10 private stations,” said Jeffrey Manber, chief executive of NanoRacks, a company that arranges commercial use of I.S.S. and is also planning its own orbital outposts. “Some for entertainment, some for research, some for in-space manufacturing, some for preparing the way for our journey to Mars. At long last, our more pragmatic aspirations are becoming reality.”

TV and film projects in orbit are attracting the greatest attention so far. In the year ahead, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, and a Russian broadcaster, Channel One, are behind a project in the year ahead to send Yulia Peresild, an actress, and Klim Shipenko, a filmmaker, to the space station to make the movie “Challenge.” Ms. Peresild will play a surgeon sent to orbit to save the life of a Russian astronaut.

They will be flying on a Russian Soyuz rocket. So will a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant. Their 12-day trip, scheduled to launch in December, is a prelude for a more ambitious around-the-moon trip Mr. Maezawa hopes to embark on in a few years in the giant SpaceX Starship rocket currently in development. His trip to the space station is being arranged by Space Adventures, a company that arranged eight similar visits for private citizens between 2001 and 2009.

There is still the possibility of Tom Cruise going to space, too.

A year ago, Deadline reported that NASA was in discussions with the megamovie star on shooting an action-adventure film on the station. Since then, nothing more of Mr. Cruise’s out-of-this-world movie project has been revealed publicly.

DEFINING MOMENTS IN ORBITLook back at 20 years of promise, peril and fun aboard the International Space Station.
There will also be other trips to space going places other than the space station. Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur, has bought an orbital trip from SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk.

A bit closer to Earth, two companies, Virgin Galactic, founded by Richard Branson, and Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, are getting closer to flying tourists on short, suborbital flights that will offer a few minutes of weightlessness.

On Saturday, Virgin Galactic conducted a successful test flight of its SpaceShipTwo rocket plane. And Blue Origin has announced that its New Shepard spacecraft will have people aboard its next flight, scheduled for July 20, and it is auctioning one seat. As of Wednesday, the high bid was $2.8 million.

Axiom Space, the Houston company, is central to some coming trips to the space station. Its first flight to the International Space Station, which is to launch aboard a SpaceX rocket as early as January, will carry three passengers, who are spending $55 million each for their eight days or so in orbit. Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut who is now a vice president at Axiom, will accompany them, serving as commander of the mission.

This month’s announcement was the first time NASA acknowledged that the Axiom mission was officially on the space station schedule.

“We’re finally able to open our doors to private citizens and allow others to experience the magic of living and working in space,” said Dana Weigel, deputy manager for the space station at NASA. “The dream is really to allow everyone access to space, and this is a pretty exciting starting point here.”

Producers of Discovery’s “Who Wants to Be an Astronaut” expect the winner to be on board for the second Axiom mission to the space station, which might take off six or seven months after the first one. For now, an agreement between the Discovery team and Axiom has not been finalized, and NASA has yet to choose Axiom to conduct the second private space tourism flight.

The NASA-led part of the station could accommodate two private astronaut missions a year, space agency officials have said, and other companies are also interested in participating.

“We are seeing a lot of interest in private astronaut missions, even outside of Axiom,” Ms. Weigel said. “At this point, the demand exceeds what we actually believe the opportunities on station will be.”

Still, on Tuesday, Axiom announced two people who would be in the seats for that second mission: Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut who now works for Axiom, will be the commander, and John Shoffner, a paying passenger who made his fortune as head of a company that manufactures conduits for fiber optic cables, will serve as pilot for the mission.

Dr. Whitson, who holds the record for the most cumulative time in space by a NASA astronaut — 665 days — joined Axiom as a consultant a year ago, in hopes of getting to space again and adding to her record. “Yes, most definitely,” she said. “That was the carrot.”

Mr. Peterson said plans for the Discovery show grew out of discussions with Axiom early in 2020 and that it would be “a premium documentary” and less like “Survivor” or other ruthless reality television competitions.

“There’s real stakes here, unlike those kinds of comparisons,” Mr. Peterson said. “We want to create an interest in somebody, so that everyone can feel like they maybe someday have the ability to do this.”

Paul Ricci, a founder of BoomTown Content Company and also involved in the show, said the competition will be based on what astronauts and others who have worked in human spaceflight have said was needed to succeed.

“If these are the qualities that astronauts need to have,” Mr. Ricci said, “then we can model challenges that test those qualities. Things like problem solving, teamwork, precision and focus, grace under pressure, handling the unexpected.”

The idea of staging competitions to get to space is not new. In 1990, Toyohiro Akiyama, a Japanese television journalist, went to the Russian space station Mir. The Tokyo Broadcasting Service bought the seat on the Soyuz and Mr. Akiyama was selected from 163 candidates. A year later, Helen Sharman, an English chemist, also flew to Mir, selected from among 13,000 British applicants in a privately financed campaign.

A space-based reality television show is not a new idea either. In 2000, NBC signed a deal for a show developed by Mark Burnett, who had also produced “The Apprentice” and “Survivor.” The winner of that competition would have also traveled to Mir, but NASA pressed Russia to abandon Mir and shift its focus to the International Space Station, which was in the early stages of construction.

Russia relented, Mir was nudged to a watery crash in the Pacific in 2001, and the reality television show never came to fruition.

As for Mr. Cruise, it is a guessing game when he and the movie director he is working with, Doug Liman, might head to the space station, and Axiom has never commented on whether it is involved in Mr. Cruise’s movie.

Asked on Monday if there were any developments that could be shared, Amanda Lundberg, Mr. Cruise’s publicist, replied, “Thanks but this is not possible.”"
"60b35f4959458642809a531b","Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday said the company continues to engage closely with partner Jio on the initiative of building an affordable smartphone and that work is underway on the project.

Last year, Google had picked up a 7.7 per cent stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 33,737 crore. It had also entered into a commercial agreement with Jio Platforms to jointly develop an entry-level, affordable smartphone.

“We are focused on building an affordable phone… we are committed to making progress on the project and we are working with them (Jio),” Pichai said in a virtual conference with select reporters from Asia Pacific.

He, however, did not divulge other details, including possible launch date and pricing. Availability of affordable devices, along with cheap data rates can help bring the internet within reach for more people across the country.

Google’s investment in Jio Platforms was part of ‘Google for India Digitisation Fund’ that was announced last year. In July last year, Pichai had unveiled plans to invest Rs 75,000 crore (USD 10 billion) in India over the next five to seven years to help accelerate the adoption of digital technologies in the country.

“Google is also looking at new opportunities to deploy funds from its USD 10 billion India Digitisation Fund (IDF), and will make some announcements later this year,” Pichai said on Thursday.

Talking about the impact of COVID-19 on these projects, Pichai said the pandemic has highlighted the importance technology plays in people’s lives.

“We realise the importance technology plays, and be it building products like Google Meets or working to make sure all of this works well on their (telecom operators’) networks, and bringing more affordable access to smartphones and computing, it’s just deepened our efforts there,” he said.

The India-born executive also talked about some of the announcements made earlier this month at its flagship I/O 2021 event. The company had announced a slew of new features including new privacy settings, AI tools and release of the first beta of Android 12 that will become part of its products over the course of the year.

Talking about ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in technology, Pichai said it is still early days and that the company is approaching the subject by being transparent, sharing and publishing research, and highlighting AI principles among other ways.

“Over time, we’ll have to figure out responsible AI regulations, which promotes innovation, but balances it with responsible oversight…We should never lose sight of the benefits AI is going to bring, just like technology has always brought tremendous benefits and work hard to address the downsides and mitigate it, I think that’s a construct all of us have to do globally,” he said.

Pichai added that Google intends to be a “responsible partner” and thought leader in this area. “We are all investing in privacy preserving, I think we all need to improve practices across the industry, and we are working to do that on the web and mobile. We need to meet user expectations,” he said.

Pichai noted that there is premium (paid) content and free content which is ad supported, and that both are available to users.” We just need to give users tools and controls, choices and newer techniques by which we preserve their privacy,” he added."
"60b35f7e59458642809a531c","“Two blue ticks, and one red tick means the government can take action against, while three red ticks will mean that the government has started court proceedings against you.” This is what a new message claims on WhatsApp, though it should be noted that all of the claims made in this viral message are fake. A similar three red ticks message had gone viral last year, and was debunked last year as well.

The message claims WhatsApp has introduced new communication rules and is being shared at a time when the Facebook-owned app has gone to court over the government of India’s new IT rules, which include a traceability clause. While the traceability rules are being challenged, users should note that WhatsApp remains private and end-to-end encrypted meaning no third-party, be it Facebook or WhatsApp or even the government can read your messages.

The viral message, which has the ‘forwarded many times label’ says once the new rules are implemented, all calls will be recorded and social media accounts will also be monitored. It says if a user shares a negative message against the government or on a religious issue, then you will get arrested. Again, all of the claims made are fake and users should not forward this message. 

The fake message even claims that your devices will get “connected to the ministry system.” The viral message also asserts that the Facebook-owned company has implemented a new tick system, allowing users to find out if the messages they are sending are being checked by the government.

It is important to note that WhatsApp has not implemented any new communication rules and there is no such feature as three red tick or three blue ticks. As of now, when a user sends a message, you get one tick, which means the message has been sent, and two ticks mean the message has been delivered. If there are two blue ticks, then it means that the message has been read by the receiver.

Just recently, a fake message was circulated on WhatsApp, saying there is a new rule which allows WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram to use your images, messages, files, and other information for their personal gain. All these messages are fake and WhatsApp users are advised to not forward them to everyone.



Can anyone read or access your WhatsApp messages?
The messaging app is end-to-end encrypted, so only the sender and the receiver can access any message they have exchanged. All your chats, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, status updates and calls can’t be accessed by WhatsApp, Facebook, or the government. Only you or the person you are communicating with can check chats.

End-to-end encryption means that your messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key needed to unlock and read them. You can verify if the messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted by visiting the profile of an individual.

You then need to tap on “Encryption.” Here, you can scan the code or compare the 60-digit numbers with the recipient. If the result is similar, then it means your messages are secured.

The codes that you get are unique to each chat and can be compared between people in each chat. In case you get a “security code changed” notification on WhatsApp, then it means that your contact reinstalled WhatsApp or changed phones."

Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said the chief ministers of opposition-ruled states should be grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his able leadership during the pandemic as unlike them, he led the country from the front and did not pass the buck.

“Today, PM landed at Kalaikunda airbase after conducting an aerial survey in Odisha and West Bengal. When the PM arrived to attend the review meeting, there was no one from the West Bengal Government,” a source said and added, “Both chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the chief secretary of West Bengal were present in the same premises and yet they did not come to receive the PM.”

An official said the prime minister, governor Jagdeep Dhankad and union ministers patiently waited for half an hour for West Bengal representatives to turn up. “Suddenly Mamata Banerjee, in her haughtiness, stormed in and handed over a bunch of papers on the cyclone impact to the PM and said that she is leaving as she has other visits lined up,” sources said.
A government source said if this was not shocking enough, Mamata Banerjee even did not allow officers of the West Bengal government like chief secretary and the home secretary to make a presentation. “The entire presentation was loaded on the screen. However, her pettiness prevented officers from presenting it to the PM,” sources said.

He said the PM took out time to review the damage in WB, but the CM’s politics and pettiness prevented it from happening. “Mamata is only harming the interests of people of WB by this petulant behaviour,” he added.
He said never before in the history of the Indian Republic has a Chief Minister of a state behaved in such an ugly, disrespectful and arrogant manner with High constitutional position holders such as Prime Minister and Governor.
“Mamata Banerjee's arrogance is directed, in her own mind, against the Prime Minister. But actually, she is harming the people of West Bengal by refusing to discuss their issues even during the time of a natural calamity,” the source said.
Referring to Banerjee’s objection to the presence of state leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari in the review meeting, the government sources said that since Cyclone Yaas is a natural calamity affecting the entire states of Odisha and West Bengal, therefore, it was imperative that the “collective energies of all the elected representatives of people are pooled together” for quick and effective disaster relief.

“Accordingly LoP of both Odisha and West Bengal were invited in the respective meetings with PM. However, since LoP in Odisha is recovering from Covid-19, hence he was unable to attend his meeting,” sources said and added, “The conduct by Mamata Banerjee, even during a natural calamity, is deplorable and reeks of low level petty politics.”
He said Suvendu Adhikari is a duly recognized LoP by Speaker of West Bengal assembly and only after this recognition has he been invited to be part of the meeting.
“Contrast the disdain of Mamata Banrejee for elected representatives of people representing a large section of the people with the statesmanship of PM Modi who got several acts amended so that Leader of Largest Opposition party in Lok Sabha has a say in decision making,” source said.
As per rules, there is no LoP in Lok Sabha since no party could win 20% of the seats. However, to accommodate Congress leaders in Lok Sabha, the Modi government amended several acts - like the selection committee of CBI - so that the opposition leader has a voice.
“Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, was also contacted to be part of the meeting. He has thanked the PM for the invitation but since he is in Delhi hence is unable to attend,” sources said and asserted that the central government is doing its best to bring everyone on board for collective cause while it is only Mamata Banerjee who is indulging in vendetta politics."

Chief minister Soren had lashed out at the centre, saying how can one imagine that Jharkhand will allow its ""suraksha kavach"" (protective gear) to go waste? CoWIN portal developed by the central government for the vaccination programme displays the vaccine wastage data for Jharkhand at 38.45 per cent till May 27.

“We had received representations from market associations after which we decided to change the timings. However, the shops will continue to open as per teh odd-even system,” Khattar said.

Malls will now be allowed to open from 10 am to 6 pm, subject to certain conditions, he said.

Number of visitors allowed inside a mall will depend on the size of the structure, the chief minister added.

“For example, in a 1,000 square feet mall, 40 people will be allowed at a time, and if it has an area of 2,000 square feet, the number of people allowed at a given time will be 80,” he said.

Those allowed entry can stay inside for a limited duration, and entry of others will be permitted based on how many are inside the mall at a particular time, Khattar added.

“Mall operators will have to come out with a mechanism for this, and they will have to take necessary permission from deputy commissioners concerned,” he said.



Colleges, industrial training institutes and schools will remain closed till June 15 as already announced, the chief minister said.

The BJP has claimed that the Congress is behind it, a charge the opposition party has rejected. It has instead blamed the BJP and sought police probe into the matter.


Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, however, had taken strong exceptions to the project being dubbed as “Auschwitz” and said “one can criticise and be venomous” about it but such terms should not be used in courtrooms.

Countering the petitioners’ claims, the Centre’s law officer had said one of the petitioners had been opposed to the project long before it got the go-ahead from the Supreme Court in January this year.

He said the petitioners were not concerned with the health and safety of workers at other construction sites in the city.

“Public interest is very selective (in the instant case) about the health of workmen,” he had added and urged the court to dismiss the plea.

He had said the petitioners cannot decide what is the safe timeline for completing the project and the company has to finish it by November so that the Republic Day parade can be held on the Rajpath.



The project entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the petition, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha, had said.

The project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the Prime Minister and the Vice-President. It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries’ offices.

"60b364a859458642809a5325","The Congress on Saturday asked for a police case to be registered against Lok Sabha member Tejasvi Surya and his uncle, BJP MLA Ravi Subramanya, for allegedly “seeking commission” for “arranging Covid-19 vaccines” at a private hospital in Karnataka, after a couple of audio clips went viral. Congress also demanded a suo-motu FIR against the BJP MLA for “taking commission” for vaccines.

In one such audio, a social worker named Venkatesh is heard questioning why each dose of vaccine was priced at Rs 900 when a voice from the other side, purported to be of a staff member of a private hospital located in south Bengaluru, says that the hospital had to pay Rs 700 to (Basavanagudi) MLA Ravi Subramanya who “arranged the vaccines” for them.

Surya has been promoting the vaccination drive at a private hospital, situated in Kumaraswamy Layout. One such tweet from his account, dated May 25 read, “Vaccination drive for B’luru South, led by Vasavi Hospital. 15,000 COVISHIELD (1st dosage only) are made available for 18+ in the 1st phase. Vaccination only with prior registration. No walk-ins. Register on https://vasavi-vaccination.in&#8221;


However, MLA Subramanya denied allegations that surfaced against him terming them “baseless” and as “part of a political conspiracy” against him. “Certain miscreants have used my name in an allegation about COVID Vaccine charges through an audio recording…It is a shame that these miscreants have indulged in such transgression, when the world is working towards a common good to help each other during the pandemic. The couple who have colluded should be chastened so that the public is not misguided, with a false claim,” he said in a series of tweets.

The MLA also visited the private hospital where he was seen visibly upset as he lashed out at the staff for “bringing him a bad name.” Later, he told reporters that he was only working with the local municipal body BBMP to vaccinate frontline workers in his constituency. “I will file a criminal case against the person who falsely claimed I was supplying vaccines,” he said.

 Ravi Subramanya
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the private hospital clarified that the MLA had “no connection” with the “independent” vaccination drive being organised. “The vaccines are procured by the hospital and arcs administered to people by charging the government prescribed rate.”

Later, Venkatesh shared a written complaint with the media stating the “vested interest” is evident in the “advertisement given by Surya” promoting the drive at the hospital. Citing the purported audio clip, he mentioned, “..wherein the hospital representative mentions that the vaccine can be procured from the office of the MLA of Girinagar Mr. Ravi Subramanyam and from Vasavi Hospital…The advertisement of Tejasvi Surya also showcases the name of Vasavi Hospital (sic).”



However, neither Girinagar nor Basavanagudi police stations chose to confirm any such complaint reaching them. “We have not received any complaint by name Venkatesh in it yet. However, a complaint that came to me directly airing allegations against the hospital’s vaccination programme has been forwarded to Kumaraswamy Layout police station,” DCP (South) Harish Pandey told Indianexpress.com.

Earlier this month, Surya, Subramanya, and two other MLAs — Satish Reddy (Bommanahalli) and Uday Garudachar (Chickpet) ‘raided’ a Covid-19 war room in Bengaluru South, tasked with allotting beds, alleging irregularities in the allotment of beds through the centralised system run by the BJP.

However, as the Central Crime Branch probe into the matter continues, an accused named M Babu (34) — with links to MLA Reddy’s personal assistant — has also been arrested. This comes at a time when Surya’s action of reading out names of 17 people with Muslim names seeking clarification on the ‘cash for beds scam’ is still being criticised, and voiced as his attempts to “communalise” the issue by many including leaders from the Opposition."

The committee is led by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, with former Delhi MP, J P Agarwal, and general secretary in charge of Punjab, Harish Rawat, as members.

“We will meet them individually and listen to them. After listening to their issues, we will sort out the matter,” Rawat said after the meeting. The committee will also meet Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar.

Rawat added, “We will also meet Captain sahib, Jakhar sahib, Sidhu ji, Randhawa ji, Channi ji and Partap Bajwa ji. We may come to Chandigarh also to hold these meetings.”

He reiterated that there would be no change in the government and the party organisation in Punjab.

"60b3651d59458642809a5327","This has turned out to be the year in which Narendra Modi ran out of luck and leadership. Could this be the reason why the second anniversary of his second term went almost unnoticed last week? Usually, it is an occasion in which his ministers, party men and ‘bhakts’ raise their voices in praise of his ‘great’ leadership. Usually, departments of the Government of India compete to place huge advertisements plastered with pictures of the leader and words of effusive praise in the media. This time on May 26 these advertisements were conspicuously absent. There are reports that a hefty document has been produced to commemorate the seven years of Modi’s rule but if it was released online last week, it was done quietly. Leaks to newspapers say that it praises Modi for his ‘strong and sensitive leadership during Covid’. If this is true, it will sound like mockery.

As a former ‘Modi bhakt’ I wanted this to be a fair mid-term assessment, so I thought long and hard but was unable to come up with shining achievements. The Prime Minister said last week while virtually addressing Buddhists on Buddha Purnima that historians would look back on our pandemic years as a time that was ‘pre-Covid and post-Covid’. It was this measure that I used to analyse his second term. In his pre-Covid months Modi travelled to countries far and near. Most memorably there was ‘Howdy Modi’ in Houston which he may have hoped would match that magnificent event organised in 2014 by the Indian diaspora in New York. Donald Trump came to Howdy Modi and the crowd was huge, but spontaneity was missing.

In between foreign travels in those first few months Modi gave priority to implementing what some think of as the Hindutva agenda. Article 370 was abrogated, triple ‘talaq’ was made a criminal offence and then came that amendment to the Citizenship Act that specified that except for Muslims, refugees of other faiths would be on a fast track to get Indian citizenship. The amendment may have gone through quietly if the Home Minister had not made it into an election issue and warned, in menacing tones, that the next step was a National Register of Citizens. Indian Muslims saw this as a signal that they could lose their citizenship if they were unable to give proof of it and took to the streets in protest in cities across India. The Prime Minister had to personally assure Muslims that his government had no immediate plans for a citizens register.

This assurance came too late and tensions between Hindus and Muslims were so high that Delhi saw communal riots for the first time in 30 years at exactly the moment when there was a State banquet for Donald Trump in Rashtrapati Bhawan. Modi’s supporters blamed the riots not on ugly speeches by BJP leaders but on an a ‘jihadist’ conspiracy. Student leaders remain in jail under preventive detention for having ‘masterminded’ the protests. BJP leaders who believe that the only way to win elections is by dividing Hindus and Muslims hoped the riots would help them win elections in Delhi. This did not happen.

Tensions were still high when Covid arrived in March last year. Its first wave was gentle and caused few deaths. It caused terrible suffering for migrant workers who were forced to walk hundreds of kilometres to their homes because the Prime Minister’s decision to close India down at four hours’ notice left them jobless and homeless and bereft of public transport. But, when the death toll was remarkably low and our fragile health system held up, Modi took full credit for having shown decisive and exemplary leadership. In a speech this January to the World Economic Forum, he said India had defeated Covid in a way that should inspire other countries.

He was so sure that this was true that he allowed hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to gather for the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. Then off he went along with the Home Minister and the BJP president to campaign in West Bengal. The business of governing India was left mostly in the hands of bureaucrats, and they chose to ignore the early warnings of a second wave. The catastrophe that resulted is such recent history that it does not need elucidating. What does need to be said is that in the worst crisis that India has faced in decades, the Prime Minister has failed to lead. Once he recovered from the shock of losing in Bengal and returned home to confront the death and devastation, he took to appearing in his virtual incarnation to offer tears and sympathy. But to this day, there is no certainty that India will manage to get the 200 crore vaccinations we need this year for our adult population, or how we are going to get the same amount next year when boosters will be needed.

Last week farmers marked May 26 as a Black Day because it coincidentally was exactly six months since their agitation began against Modi’s three farm laws. The last thing we need is for the protests on Delhi’s borders to begin again. Modi has so far failed to satisfy farmers that the laws will benefit them. All in all, it can be said that this has without question been the worst year of Modi’s political career. There is nothing to celebrate.

“There have been over 750 cases of black fungus in Haryana so far. Fifty-eight have been cured while 50 people have lost their lives and 650 patients are seeking treatment,” Khattar said during a news conference here.

Addressing the conference virtually, he said the government was procuring the injection used in treatment of black fungus while some stock was already available and was being used in government hospitals.

“We have got 6,000 injection vials. Over the next two days, we will get 2,000 vials more while we have placed an order for another 5,000 vials,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Health Minister Anil Vij had directed officials to increase the number of beds in all government medical colleges of the state from 20 to 75 to treat patients infected with black fungus or mucormycosis.

Vij had directed officials that medicines should be made available to these patients as required without any delay and that there should be no shortage of injections and other medicines.

The number of black fungus or mucormycosis cases has been on the increase in the state during the past two weeks.

Earlier, Vij had said the state government has made a requisition of 12,000 injections of Amphotericin-B, the drug used for treating black fungus, from the central government.

“During normal times, India used to produce 900 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in a day. Now, that figure has gone up to about 9,500 metric tonnes every day to supply the life-saving gas to hospitals treating Covid-19 patients,” he added.

His address comes at a time when the country has been recording nearly 2 lakh fresh Covid-19 cases and over 3,000 related deaths every day.


During the address, the Prime Minister also lauded the countrymen for displaying immense resolve while fighting the second wave of Covid-19, a pandemic that he described as the “worst in 100 years”. “India’s resolve to face it has always been greater. The collective strength of the country and our spirit of service have helped the country tide through all crisis,” he added.

The Prime Minister also praised the people of the states affected by the two cyclones (Tauktae and Yaas), which hit the country in a month, and said they showed courage, patience and discipline. “I respectfully and wholeheartedly respect all the citizens,” he said during his Mann Ki Baat address.

“Those who came forward and took part in the relief and rescue work, any amount appreciation for all these people will be less. I salute them all. I express my deepest condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. We all stand with the people who have suffered losses,” Modi added.



Commemorating the NDA government on completing seven years in office, Modi said, “When we see that India does not work as per the thoughts and pressure of other nations but according to its resolve, we feel proud.”

He added, “Over the years, the country has run on the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’. When India does not compromise on issues of national security, when the strength of our forces increases, we feel that we are on the right track.”

During the address, Modi spoke with a liquid oxygen tanker driver, a woman railway driver and an air force officer involved in transportation of oxygen and related equipment to drive home the point on how these people are working overtime to ensure oxygen reaches those in need."

"60b3680359458642809a532f","After seeking maximum autonomy by states over Covid-19 vaccination in India, the Opposition-led states have taken a U-turn, blaming the Centre over vaccine mismanagement. But what are the facts?

CHRONOLOGY OF VACCINE DRIVE
On April 19, amidst the raging second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the extension of Covid vaccination programme to those aged between 18 and 44 years from May 1. A liberalised and accelerated phase 3 strategy of the National Covid-19 Vaccination Program was announced. The policy made these points clear:

-- Vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly production to central government, 50% doses to state governments and private players or and the open market.

-- Manufacturers have to declare the price for 50% supply to state governments, private players or and the open market Policy allowed direct procurement from vaccine makers for state governments, private hospitals, industrial establishments.

The Centre also put conditions on the quota of vaccines to be allocated to states based on the extent of active Covid cases and performance such as speed of vaccine administration. Wastage of vaccine was seen as a negative point for quota allocation.

VACCINE PRICE MORE FOR STATES
On April 21, Serum Institute of India announced the cost of Covishield for states at Rs 400 per dose and for private players at Rs 600 per dose, even as the Centre would continue to purchase the vaccine at a nominal Rs 200 per dose. On April 24, Bharat Biotech announced rates for Covaxin at Rs 600 per dose for states and Rs 1200 per dose for private facilities.

The Opposition questioned why the same vaccines were being given at different rates to the Centre and the states. Soon after the political uproar, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla dropped the rate of Covishield to Rs 300, calling it a “philanthropic gesture” for states. Bharat Biotech followed SII and slashed Covaxin prices to Rs 400 per dose.

Many states like Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, Sikkim, West Bengal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Union Territory Jammu and Kashmir announced free vaccines for those between the ages of 18-44 in government vaccine centres.

But just as the states began to open vaccinations for the targeted group, the vaccine stocks began to dry up and many vaccine centres stopped taking appointments.

REASONS BEHIND DIFFERENTIAL VACCINE PRICE
Neither Serum Institute nor Bharat Biotech was able to meet production commitments made to India. Questions were raised on the export of 6.6 crore vaccines from India to the world at a time when the country was staring at a severe vaccine shortage.

Till date, the monthly production capacity of SII is stuck at 6.5 crore doses while Bharat Biotech is producing just about 1-1.5 crore doses. States began to look outside the country and began floating global tenders.

STATES FLOAT GLOBAL TENDERS FOR VACCINES
Maharashtra floated a global tender for 5 crore doses and set the deadline to May 26. The state is trying to reach out to Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson for procuring Covid vaccines. Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation have decided to jointly float global tenders for purchasing vaccines directly from the manufacturer.

Similarly, Uttar Pradesh floated a global tender for 4 crore doses on May 7. Tamil Nadu floated a tender to procure 3.5 crore vaccines on May 15. Kerala floated tenders for three crore doses. In Karnataka, te state government’s tender for two crore vaccines has been split into four tenders for supply of 50 lakh doses each at a total cost of Rs 843 crore.

Goa will float a global tender for procurement of vaccines to expedite the walk-in vaccination for the 18-44 age group. Delhi wants to get 1 crore vaccine doses under the global tender but is also open to making a deal with manufacturers at its own level.

GLOBAL TENDERS ARE NON-STARTERS
However, the global tenders have proved to be non-starters. The Delhi government announced that Moderna and Pfizer have refused vaccines, saying they will deal with the Centre directly. Punjab government also made similar claims, saying Moderna refused to send vaccine directly to the state. Even Maharashtra Health Minister was equally critical of the state jostling with each other over tenders for the vaccine.

Meanwhile, the daily vaccination figures from the central government show a stock of vaccines that the Centre has allocated to the states which are lying unused in each state and more allocation is in pipeline. But BJP-led central government claims politics over pandemic.

DELHI VS CENTRE
BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said only 13% of people, who have been vaccinated in the national capital, have got their vaccines from the Delhi government. “Nearly 46 lakh [4.6 million] free vaccines were supplied by the Centre to Delhi. Private hospitals... procured about 9 lakh [90,00,00] doses of vaccines while the Delhi government managed to procure just a little over 8 lakh [80,00,00],” he said.

Patra said private hospitals have managed to get more vaccines on their own than the Delhi government. He said the Aam Aadmi Party government should also clarify how many doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine has it ordered and paid for.

Referring to the Delhi government’s claim that companies such as Pfizer and Moderna have refused to sell vaccines to state governments directly, Patra said the Centre has amended the rules to allow vaccines certified by international agencies or listed for emergency use by the WHO to be allowed for use in India.

“There are constraints in the supply of vaccines,” he said.

He said the Centre is talking to these companies and working to procure vaccines. “Political leaders such as Arvind Kejriwal, who are asking questions, should remember this is not something that can be bought off the shelf. There is a process to be followed,” he said

HEALTH MINISTRY’S REBUTTAL
The Union Health Ministry issued a point-by-point rebuttal on claims made by Opposition-led states that the Centre is not doing enough to buy vaccines from abroad.

“The central government has remained engaged continuously with all the major international vaccine manufacturers right from mid-2020. Multiple rounds of discussions have happened with Pfizer, J&J and Moderna. Government offered all assistance to have them supply and /or manufacture their vaccines in India. However, it is not that their vaccines are available in free supply. We need to understand that buying vaccines internationally is not similar to buying ‘off the shelf’ items. Vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies have their own priorities, game-plans and compulsions in allocating finite stocks,” the press statement from the ministry said.

“They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine makers have done unhesitatingly for us. As soon as Pfizer indicated vaccine availability, Central Government and the company are working together for the earliest possible import of the vaccine. As a result of GoI’s efforts, Sputnik vaccine trials got accelerated and with timely approval, Russia has already sent two tranches of vaccines & accomplished tech-transfer to our companies that would start manufacturing very soon,” it added.

NO FREE VACCINES FOR 18+
The central government data shows more than 1.38 crore beneficiaries of the 18-44 age group have been vaccinated as of May 26, even as state governments like Delhi have shut down government vaccine centres citing shortage of vaccines for those above 18 years.

Meanwhile, private hospitals in the same state continue to vaccinate those who can afford to pay a higher price for the Covid-19 jab. Why is the vaccination stock for those above 18+ drying up while the Centre supplies vaccines for those above 45+ years?"
"60b3686259458642809a5330","As the second and deadlier wave of the coronavirus is receding in Uttar Pradesh, all eyes are now once again focusing back on the 2022 assembly polls. The results of the panchayat elections this month may have boosted the confidence of the Samajwadi Party, but a close look at the numbers reveals the Bharatiya Janata Party bettered its performance from the 2015 edition. It will be interesting to see, however, how the ruling party handles the impact of the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new agricultural reforms that has gained momentum in the western parts of the state, say observers.

While the BJP says it will return to power next year with more seats than it had won in the 2017 assembly polls, the SP maintains the saffron party has failed people of the UP during the pandemic and people will express their anger through their votes.

The Uttar Pradesh assembly houses 403 seats, of which the BJP won 312 in 2017, followed by the SP with 47 and the Bahujan Samaj Party with 19. The BSP, however, polled more votes than the SP. According to data available, in the 2017 elections, the state had about 14.05 crore voters of which 7.7 crore were men and 6.3 crore women.

Are the panchayat polls bellwether for 2022?

Many saw the panchayat elections as a semi-final for the assembly polls as they give an idea of the ground situation prevailing in the rural parts. The SP says the candidates supported by it performed extremely well as there is resentment against the government among the people in the countryside. The BJP says it fared better than it did in 2015. The polls are not contested on party symbols but candidates effectively represent one political party or another. More than 8.69 lakh posts were up for grabs in the rural polls. Of these, over 7.32 lakh seats were in the gram panchayat wards, 58,176 in the gram panchayats, 75,852 in the kshetra (block) panchayats and 3,050 in the zilla panchayats. The state election commission said more than 3.19 lakh candidates were elected unopposed.

Speaking to News18, SP spokesperson Sunil Singh Sajan said, “The mandate that the Samajwadi Party has got in the panchayat elections, even after misuse of power by the BJP and the administration working in their favour, it proves that the people are angry and fed up with the BJP. The panchayat elections are always an indicator of the ground situation in the state. The panchayat elections have also proved that they are now looking towards the Samajwadi Party and its chief Akhilesh Yadav. If the panchayat elections were held today, BJP leaders wouldn’t have been able to enter villages with the BJP flag on their vehicles. In 2022, the BJP leaders will not be able to roam around with the party flag. The farmers are also upset with them along with unemployed youth, Dalits and those who have lost their family members due to the coronavirus.”

BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi expressed satisfaction at his party’s performance while maintaining that it would have done better but for the pandemic. “This was the first panchayat election of Uttar Pradesh where the BJP came out and extended full-fledged support to candidates. However, due to Covid, we could not use many of our star campaigners. But still we have done remarkably well, going by the number of BJP-supported candidates that had won in 2015. The Samajwadi Party didn’t even support the number of candidates that they are claiming have won. This was our first-time experiment and we have done remarkably well. If Covid protocols were not in place, we would have done even better.”

Will Covid influence assembly poll results?

The ruling party says it can’t be blamed for a pandemic as it is a natural phenomenon prevailing all over the world. However, the Samajwadi Party alleges that people haven’t just died because of Covid but also due to the mismanagement and unpreparedness of the government.

“The coronavirus cannot give political mileage to anyone; the entire world was affected by this and not just Uttar Pradesh. Had it been only limited to the state and caused by some political mistake, then definitely there could have been repercussions. But people today are updated through the media and social media that corona has affected people in England also, for instance, and not just India. Going by the size of the state, population, health infrastructure and per capita income, the way Uttar Pradesh has performed, it will only be a positive for the BJP,” said Tripathi. “The BJP is the only party which has, through its organisational setup, stood with the people of the state in difficult times. Others like the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party didn’t help anyone, be it this time or the last time when migrant labourers were returning to the state. We even distributed slippers to them.”

Analysts say Uttar Pradesh has so far seen politics of alliances, caste and religion, and it will be interesting to see if the coronavirus is able to alter the equations significantly.

The SP is of the opinion that Covid will be a key factor in the 2022 assembly polls. “The entire country is fighting with the coronavirus and everyone has acted responsibly barring those who should have acted responsibly. The people who are in power, who could have arranged for beds in hospitals, oxygen, medicines, such people not just showed laxity but also embezzled funds in the name of Covid. People who have lost their near and dear ones due to lack of oxygen, shortage of beds and non-availability of ambulances, how will they forget this cruel face of the BJP?” said Sajan.

Are parties prepared for the 2022 battle?

With less than seven months to go for the elections, observers say political parties have already chalked out their plan and have started to work silently towards achieving their goals.

“The Samajwadi Party has been continuously working towards strengthening its organisation. Before the second wave of Covid, our national president (Akhilesh Yadav) was visiting districts, attending training camps of the cadres and was meeting people continuously. During the first wave and the second wave, Samajwadi Party workers were helping the people. Many of those who died during the pandemic were given financial assistance by the party and even today the party has been demanding compensation for the teachers who lost their lives during panchayat election duty due to corona. Our national president is personally speaking to the families of these teachers and we will continue to do whatever it takes to help the people of the state,” Sajan said.

Speaking about his party’s preparedness, Rakesh Tripathi said the BJP will return to power. “Our party had issued a Sankalp Patra in 2017 about how we would run the government and we have met most of the promises. We have a lot of achievements to tell the people, right from farmers’ issues, jobs, fight against corruption and maintaining law and order. We will go to the public with our achievements and I am sure the BJP will return to power with even more seats in the 2022 assembly polls,” he said.

What experts say

While a slight dent has been caused to the BJP government due to over-reliance on officers, Covid won’t be able to topple it, many experts say. They also feel that Akhilesh Yadav has an advantage as people still remember the work done by him and he has strongly positioned himself as the main opposition leader in UP.

Speaking to news18, political observer and commentator Ratan Mani Lal said, “There has been a dent to the BJP and it cannot be denied, as the government relied too much on the feedback given by the officers. The government kept on issuing statements that everything was under control, which was not. If the real picture was revealed then, right and corrective measures could have been taken then only, and it could have saved a lot of lives. The people who have lost their near and dear ones are not going to forgive the BJP. The chief minister is in damage control mode but the people who have suffered will remember their sufferings. However, on the other hand, most of people have accepted that this pandemic is beyond anyone’s control. This is typical Indian mentality that many people blame it on nature and faith and they are seen absolving the government. Having said that, coming back to the political aspect, Akhilesh has emerged as the sole opposition face in UP, with an experience of five years of governing the state. The governance of Akhilesh is still fresh in the minds of the people which gives him a dual advantage.”

On the aspects of the BJP countering the narrative and changing its strategy for the elections, he said that the party may not alter its game plan or project a new face. “There is very little time for any major change. The only big thing that they might do is to include some new faces in the cabinet. But there won’t be any major change and it will be more or less the same as it was in 2017. The BJP doesn’t have time to change its CM face now and Akhilesh will be by default the opposition face and will have the advantage of his governance. As per my observation, natural calamities never become an election issue in our country as many people have accepted the pandemic as their fate and they do not blame any political party for it. The BJP might lose in some areas which were badly affected by the pandemic but I don’t think that it will affect its winnability,” said Lal. “This was the first panchayat election where the BJP went all-in; earlier it used to leave things to the second line of leaders. And whatever they have gained is because of this only. It’s like Bengal where they might have lost the polls but they gained from 3 to 77 seats. The BJP will be focusing more on the districts where it has performed well in the panchayat polls to ensure a win in the assembly elections."""
